    This example creates a small, hierarchical domain model consisting
    of a compound called "domain" and its part called "greeting".
    The greeting model contains the famous "Hello, World!" character.

    As next step, the greeting model is sent to (printed on) the console.
    Finally, an "exit" operation shuts down the application.
