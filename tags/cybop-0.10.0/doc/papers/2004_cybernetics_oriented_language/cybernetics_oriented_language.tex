\section{Cybernetics Oriented Language}
\label{cybernetics_oriented_language_heading}

The introduced \emph{Cybernetics Oriented Language} (CYBOL) is based on the
principles of \emph{Human Thinking} as described in section \ref{human_thinking_heading}.
These principles and further concepts behind are summarized by the name
\emph{Cybernetics Oriented Programming} (CYBOP) (figure \ref{cybop_figure}).
They form the semantics of CYBOL. Its syntax is determined by the \emph{Extensible
Markup Language} (XML) standard and accordingly easy. It is rich enough to express
models based upon the three kinds of abstraction: \emph{Discrimination},
\emph{Categorization} and \emph{Composition} as well as meta information of a
\emph{Whole} about its \emph{Parts}.
