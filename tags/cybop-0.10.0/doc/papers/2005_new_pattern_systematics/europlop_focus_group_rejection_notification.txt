Dear Christian, Detlef and Ilka,

we are currently completing the focus group program for EuroPLoP 2005.
I am sorry to inform you that we have decided not to accept the proposed
focus group
on Pattern Systematics for this year's program. The reason is that we find
that the form
and size of your paper fall somewhat outside the scope of this conference.
Focus group
preparations/position papers of this size and complexity would take
considerably effort
from participants before making a fruitful discussion. We belive you would
find a better
audience for you paper at a conference with a stronger academic profile,
and wish you
the best of luck with a very interesting paper. We also welcome you to
re-submit a reduced
scope focus group for next year's EuroPLoP.

Best regards,
Lise Hvatum
Focus Group Coordinator
EuroPLoP 2005
