            <h4>EuroPLoP 2005 Focus Group on <i>Pattern Systematics</i></h4>
            <h6>Topic and Purpose</h6>
            <p>
                <i>"Pattern Simplifications Leading to a more Comprehensive Systematics"</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                The aim of the discussion is not to find special patterns for special purposes,<br>
                but rather to get an overall picture of many kinds of patterns,<br>
                in order to identify their structural differences or similarities.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, patterns with common structures are merged and lead back to<br>
                only a few basic patterns, organised in a simplified systematics<br>
                that hopefully helps developers to better understand, correctly choose<br>
                and use patterns.
            </p>

            <h6>Preferred Number and Experience of Participants</h6>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
                We ask conference participants who would like to join the focus group<br>
                discussion to register in advance, if possible to end of May 2005,<br>
                by sending a simple email to
                <a href="mailto:christian.heller@tu-ilmenau.de">christian.heller@tu-ilmenau.de</a>.<br>
                Depending on the number of free places, you will then be<br>
                notified about your participation in the focus group.
            </p>
            <p>
                Participants should have applied a variety of software patterns<br>
                and ideally have design experience for a couple of years (> 5?).<br>
                Nobody has to know each pattern in detail, but an overall view<br>
                would be helpful in the discussion, as well as knowledge of<br>
                the standard literature (Gamma, Buschmann, Fowler).
            </p>
            <p>
                Please bring with open-mindedness and be ready<br>
                to change your current design views.
            </p>
            <h6>Submissions and Format</h6>
            <p>
                Position papers are not required, but of course possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                It would be nice, however, to receive additional free-text submissions<br>
                (PDF, OpenOffice, ... no MS Word), raising open issues in (object-oriented)<br>
                software development with patterns, seen from different, inter-disciplinary<br>
                perspectives (any field of science or nature), and possibly containing<br>
                ideas for their solution.
            </p>
            <h6>Possible Outputs and Publication</h6>
            <ol>
                <li>A more comprehensive pattern systematics</li>
                <li>A list of open issues/ repeated problems in pattern usage</li>
                <li>Ideas and different approaches for their solution</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                The results will be summarised by the focus group leader after the conference,<br>
                in form of a short focus group report which will go into the final conference proceedings.
            </p>
