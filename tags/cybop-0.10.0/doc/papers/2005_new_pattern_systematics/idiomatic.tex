\subsubsection{Idiomatic}
\label{idiomatic_heading}

An \emph{Idiom} is a pattern on a low abstraction level. It describes how certain
aspects of components or the relations between them can be implemented using the
means of a specific programming language. Idioms can such be used to describe
the actual realization of design patterns. Besides the \emph{Counted-Pointer}
pattern, Buschmann \cite[p. 377]{buschmann} also categorizes \emph{Singleton},
\emph{Template Method}, \emph{Factory Method} and \emph{Envelope-Letter}
\cite{coplien} as \emph{Idiom}.
