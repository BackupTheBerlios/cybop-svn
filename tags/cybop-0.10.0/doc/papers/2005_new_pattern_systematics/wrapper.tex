\paragraph{Wrapper}
\label{wrapper_heading}

The \emph{Wrapper} pattern \cite{gamma1995} allows otherwise imcompatible
classes to work together. It can be seen as skin object enclosing (wrapping) an
inner core object, to which it provides access. In other words: It adapts the
interface of a class which is why Gamma et al. call the pattern \emph{Adapter}.

\begin{figure}[ht]

        \caption{Wrapper Pattern}
        \label{wrapper_figure}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

As can be seen in figure \ref{wrapper_figure}, this pattern makes heavy use of
\emph{Delegation}, where the \emph{Delegator} is the adapter (or wrapper) and
the \emph{Delegate} is the class being adapted \cite{portland}.
