\paragraph{Broker}
\label{broker_heading}

The \emph{Broker} pattern \cite{buschmann} may support the creation of an IT
infrastructure for distributed applications. It connects decoupled components
which interact through remote service invocations (figure \ref{broker_figure}).

The broker is responsible for coordinating all communication, for forwarding
requests as well as for transmitting results and exceptions.
