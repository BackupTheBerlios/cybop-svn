\paragraph{Chain of Responsibility}
\label{chain_of_responsibility_heading}

The \emph{Chain of Responsibility} pattern \cite{gamma1995} is similar to the
\emph{Composite}, in that it represents a recursive structure as well. Objects
destined to solve a task are linked with a corresponding \emph{Successor}
(figure \ref{chain_figure}), such forming a chain. If an object is not able to
solve a task, that task is forwarded to the object's successor, along the chain.

The pattern found wide application, for example in help systems, in event
handling frameworks or for exception handling. Its \emph{Handler} class is
known under synonyms like \emph{Event Handler}, \emph{Bureaucrat} or
\emph{Responder}.

Frequently, the pattern gets misused by delegating messages not only to children
but also to the parent of objects. The \emph{Hierarhical Model View Controller}
(HMVC) pattern is one example for this. It causes unfavourable bidirectional
dependencies (section \ref{bidirectional_dependency_heading}) and leads to
stronger coupling between the layers of a framework, because parent- and child
objects then reference each other.
