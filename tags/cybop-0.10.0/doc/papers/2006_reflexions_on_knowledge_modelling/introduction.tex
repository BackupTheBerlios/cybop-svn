\section{Introduction}
\label{introduction_heading}

Sometimes, describing the easy things is the most difficult. And most of the
time, it seems easier to copy existing concepts than to investigate new, but
possibly more intuitive solutions. The work described in this document tried to
question traditional concepts of software design and to correct or simplify
these by applying new ideas stemming from other scientific disciplines. It thus
wants to contribute to a better knowledge modelling.

The initially observed discrepancies belong to software engineering processes
(abstraction gaps), to the physical architecture (misleading tiers) as well as
the logical architecture (modelling mistakes) of systems. They are explained
following.
