ABSTRACT:
This document describes how existing design patterns can be extended and combined to merge their advantages into one, domain-independent software framework. This framework, called Cybernetics Oriented Programming (CYBOP), is characterized by flexibility and extensibility. Further, the concept of Ontology is used to structure the software architecture as well as to keep it maintainable. A Component Lifecycle ensures the proper startup and shutdown of any systems built on top of CYBOP.

One core component of the framework is Layer PerCom - an advanced architecture for seemless integration of communication paradigms and persistence mechanisms. Overcoming the classical scheme of thinking in terms of Domain, Frontend, Backend and Communication, PerCom treats them all similar, as passive data models which can be translated into each other - as opposed to the classical approach that unnecessarily complicates their design.

The practical proof of this combined architectural approach was accomplished within the diploma work of Torsten Kunze which consisted of an (ongoing) effort to design and develop a module called ReForm, for the Open Source Software (OSS) project Res Medicinae. The major task for this module is to provide a user interface for printing medical forms. It was used to examine the communication between modules and to find a structure for effective implementation and easy expansion.
