\section{Physical Architecture}
\label{physical_architecture_heading}

This section wants to give practical proof of the theoretical models described
before. It first introduces the project \emph{Res Medicinae} in whose frame the
software was written. Afterwards, two solutions of a physical architecture,
\emph{Two-Tier} and \emph{Three-Tier} are explained.
