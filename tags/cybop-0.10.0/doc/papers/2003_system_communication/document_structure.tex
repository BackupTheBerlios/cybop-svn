\subsection{Document Structure}
\label{document_structure_heading}

In the course of this paper, basic design patterns are introduced in section
\ref{basic_patterns_heading} and placed into the greater architecture context
in section \ref{logical_architecture_heading}.
Section \ref{hierarchy_and_ontology_heading} provides some knowledge to achieve
this, that is to apply hierarchies to obtain ontologies which finally help to
combine and merge the design patterns.
The biological considerations of section \ref{biological_reflections_heading}
greatly contribute to the resulting architectural pattern \emph{Translator}
which gets introduced in the context of system communication, in section
\ref{system_models_heading}.
Practical proof is given in section \ref{physical_architecture_heading} which
briefly describes the \emph{ReForm} software module, before the final summary
in section \ref{summary_heading}.
