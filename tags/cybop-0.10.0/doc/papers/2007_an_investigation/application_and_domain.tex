\subsubsection{Application and Domain}
\label{application_and_domain_heading}

Over the years, it has turned out to be helpful in software design, to separate
\emph{Domain Knowledge} from \emph{Application Functionality}. In
one-or-another form, the architectural software patterns \cite{heller2005}
\emph{Layers}, \emph{Domain Model} and \emph{Model View Controller} (MVC) all
suggest to apply this principle.

The \emph{Tools \& Materials} approach \cite{tandm} talks of \emph{active}
applications (tools) working on \emph{passive} domain data (material). And also
\emph{System Family Engineering} \cite{domainengg} bases on a separate
treatment of domain and application, in form of \emph{Domain Engineering} (DE)
and \emph{Application Engineering} (AE).

An often neglected fact of these approaches is that not only the domain, but
also the application contains important business knowledge (figure
\ref{separation_figure}). The \emph{User Interface} (UI), for example, is
tailored for a specific business domain. And the logic behind, if not
contained in the UI itself, is often put in a \emph{Controller} which belongs
to the application$-$, not the domain layer.

\begin{figure}[ht]

        \caption{Different Knowledge Separations}
        \label{separation_figure}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

Similarly, the domain often contains functionality which actually does belong
into the application process: \emph{Database} (DB) access is handled by help of
patterns like the \emph{Data Mapper} \cite{heller2005}, in which the mapper\\
objects contain \emph{Structured Query Language} (SQL) code to connect to a
\emph{Database Management System} (DBMS); \emph{Enterprise Java Beans} (EJB),
which should better be pure domain objects, imitate a \emph{Middleware}
providing persistence- or communication mechanisms, which originally have
nothing to do with the business knowledge they contain.

It is precisely this \emph{Mixup} of responsibilities between an application
system and its domain knowledge, that leads to multiple inter-dependencies and
hence unflexibility within a system. Instead, a separation should be made
between active \emph{System Control} and passive \emph{Knowledge}. A UI's
appearance would then be treated as domain knowledge, just as the logic of the
functions called through it. A data mapper would be transformed into a simple
\emph{Translator} -- similar to a \emph{Data Transfer Object} (DTO)
\cite{heller2005} -- that knows how to convert data from one domain model into
another; its DBMS access functionality, however, would be extracted and put
into the application system. Monstrosities like EJBs would likewise be opened
up and parted into their actual domain knowledge, and all other mechanisms
around -- the latter being moved into the application system.

To sum up this thought: The essential realisation here is that hardware-close
mechanisms like the ones necessary for data input/ output (i/o), enabling
inter-system communication, should be handled in an active application system
layer which was started as process on a computer, and \emph{not} be merged with
pure, passive domain knowledge. User interfaces and application logic which are
traditionally held in controller objects of the application layer, as well as
further business data models, should rather belong to a high-level knowledge
layer.
