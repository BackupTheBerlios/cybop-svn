\section{Reflexions on Concepts}
\label{reflexions_on_concepts_heading}

Although many of the ideas and solutions presented here, in a \emph{bottom-up}
manner, stem from writing source code in practice (following the
\emph{Constructive Development} method of research as announced in section
\ref{method_heading}), the overall approach and explanation of results follow a
\emph{top-down} path. High-level concepts are considered first, before moving
on to an implementation and proof in practice. Because of the steady comparison
to principles of nature and other sciences, this approach is called
\emph{cybernetics-oriented}, as explained in section \ref{idea_heading}. Figure
\ref{approach_figure} shows in which order the elements of CYBOP will be
considered.

\begin{figure}[ht]

\end{figure}

A first observation, when looking at human beings from a philosophical
perspective, is the separation of \emph{Mind} and \emph{Brain} (Body).
Accordingly, CYBOP treats computers as \emph{Systems} owning and processing
\emph{Knowledge}. This is not unlike the idea of \emph{Agent} systems owning a
\emph{Knowledge Base} \cite{parks,kuehnel}. All abstract knowledge that humans
make up belongs to their mind. The brain is merely a physical carrier of
knowledge. Similarly, there are actually two kinds of software: one
representing \emph{passive} knowledge and the other \emph{actively} controlling
a system's hardware.

Secondly, attention is payed to the concepts of \emph{Human Thinking}
\cite{heller2004}, as investigated by psychology. Through their application,
knowledge becomes \emph{hierarchical}. Moreover, this work tried to embed
knowledge models in an environment of \emph{Dimensions}, as known from physics.
Every model keeps a number of \emph{Meta Information} about its parts.
\emph{Positions} in space or time are one such example.

Thirdly, \emph{State-} gets distinguished from \emph{Logic} knowledge. It is
known from neurological research that the human brain has special communication
regions that, simply spoken, do nothing else than translating data, i.e. an
input- into an output \emph{State}, according to rules of \emph{Logic}. Systems
theory uses similar abstractions. When talking about states, this work means a
composed \emph{Set} of states.

In CYBOP (figure \ref{approach_figure}), all knowledge (states and logic),
belongs to a system's \emph{Statics}, and is described by CYBOL language
templates (section \ref{cybol_heading}). The processing of knowledge at
runtime, to control a system, is \emph{Dynamics} and happens in the CYBOI
interpreter (section \ref{cyboi_heading}).
