\section{Practical Proof}
\label{practical_proof_heading}

The proof of operatability for the new concepts is given by the
\emph{Cybernetics Oriented Language} (CYBOL), defined according to the
principles of abstraction worked out before, and by the
\emph{Cybernetics Oriented Interpreter} (CYBOI), a knowledge processing system.
In addition, a prototype application called \emph{Res Medicinae}
\cite{resmedicinae} was implemented in CYBOL.
