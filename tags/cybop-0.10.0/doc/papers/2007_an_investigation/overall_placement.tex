\subsubsection{Overall Placement}
\label{overall_placement_heading}

Considering an overall computer system architecture, \emph{CYBOI} is situated
between the application knowledge existing in form of \emph{CYBOL} templates
and the \emph{Hardware} controlled by an \emph{Operating System} (OS) (figure
\ref{connection_figure}). CYBOI can thus also be called a
\emph{Knowledge-Hardware-Interface} (synonymous with \emph{Mind-Brain-Interface}).

There are analogies to other systems run by language interpretation. Table
\ref{analogies_table} shows those between the \emph{Java-} and \emph{CYBOP}
world. Both are based on a programming theory, have a language and interpreter.
A theoretical model of a computer hardware- or -software system may be called
an \emph{Abstract Computer} or \emph{Abstract Machine} \cite{wikipedia}. If
being implemented as software simulation, or if containing an interpreter, it
is called a \emph{Virtual Machine} (VM). Kernighan and Pike write in their book
\emph{Practice of Programming} \cite{kernighan1999}:

\begin{quote}
    Virtual machines are a wonderful, old idea, that latterly, through Java and
    the \emph{Java Virtual Machine} (JVM), came into fashion again. They are a
    simple possibility to gain portable and efficient program code, which can
    be written in a higher programming language.
\end{quote}

In that sense, CYBOI is certainly a VM. It provides low-level, platform-dependent
system functionality, close to the OS, together with a unified knowledge schema
(section \ref{knowledge_schema_heading}) which allows CYBOL applications to be
truly portable, well extensible and easier to program, because developers need
to concentrate on domain knowledge only. Since CYBOI interprets CYBOL sources
\emph{live} at system runtime, without the need for previous compilation (as in
Java), changes to CYBOL sources get into effect right away, without restarting
the system.
