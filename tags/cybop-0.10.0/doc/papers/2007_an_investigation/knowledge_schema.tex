\subsection{Knowledge Schema}
\label{knowledge_schema_heading}

Human beings have a brain which they use to think, in other words to build up a
mind. While the former exists in the \emph{Real World}, the latter is
constructed as a subjective \emph{Virtual World}. All people do think, all the
time, even not knowing that they do. One would therefore guess that the act of
\emph{Thinking} is a most common one, familiar to anybody. But judging from the
enormous research effort in sciences dealing with it, the \emph{Principles}
behind thinking are not that easy to grasp.
