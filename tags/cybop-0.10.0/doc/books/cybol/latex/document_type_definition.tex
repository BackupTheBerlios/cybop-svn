A DTD represents the type definition of an XML document. It consists of a set
of \emph{Markup Tags} and their \emph{Interpretation} \cite{foldoc}. DTDs can
be declared inline, within a document, or as an external reference
\cite{w3schools}. Figure \ref{dtd_figure} shows the DTD of the CYBOL language.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \bigskip
    \begin{scriptsize}
        \begin{verbatim}
<!ELEMENT model (part*)>
<!ELEMENT part (property*)>
<!ELEMENT property (constraint*)>
<!ELEMENT constraint EMPTY>

<!ATTLIST part
    name CDATA #REQUIRED
    channel CDATA #REQUIRED
    abstraction CDATA #REQUIRED
    model CDATA #REQUIRED>
<!ATTLIST property
    name CDATA #REQUIRED
    channel CDATA #REQUIRED
    abstraction CDATA #REQUIRED
    model CDATA #REQUIRED>
<!ATTLIST constraint
    name CDATA #REQUIRED
    channel CDATA #REQUIRED
    abstraction CDATA #REQUIRED
    model CDATA #REQUIRED>
        \end{verbatim}
    \end{scriptsize}

\end{figure}

Following the pure hierarchical structure of CYBOL, it would actually suffice
to use a DTD as simple as the one shown in figure \ref{simpledtd_figure}. Since
the three elements \emph{part}, \emph{property} and \emph{constraint} (compare
figure \ref{dtd_figure}) have the same list of required attributes, they could
be summarised under the name \emph{part}, for example. Because the structure of
a CYBOL model is non-ambiguous, the meaning of its elements can be guessed from
their position within the model.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \bigskip
    \begin{scriptsize}
        \begin{verbatim}
<!ELEMENT part (part*)>

<!ATTLIST part
    name CDATA #REQUIRED
    channel CDATA #REQUIRED
    abstraction CDATA #REQUIRED
    model CDATA #REQUIRED>
        \end{verbatim}
    \end{scriptsize}

For the purpose of expressing knowledge in accordance with the schema suggested
by CYBOP \cite{cybop}, a CYBOL knowledge template (file) does not need to have
a root element. The file name clearly identifies it. For reasons of XML
conformity, however, an extra root element called \emph{model} was defined
(figure \ref{dtd_figure}). And for reasons of better readability and
programmability, the three kinds of embedded elements were given distinct names.
