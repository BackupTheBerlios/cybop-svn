There are many kinds of meta data besides the above-mentioned attributes, that
may be known about a model. These are given as special XML tags called
\emph{property} and \emph{constraint}. As defined in section
\ref{vocabulary_heading}, a CYBOL knowledge template may use four kinds of XML
tags:

\begin{itemize}
    \item[-] model
    \item[-] part
    \item[-] property
    \item[-] constraint
\end{itemize}

The \emph{model} tag appears just once. It is the root node which makes a CYBOL
knowledge template a valid XML document.

Of actual interest are the \emph{part} tags. They identify the models that the
\emph{whole} model described by the CYBOL knowledge template consists of.

A \emph{whole} model may know a lot more about its \emph{part} models, than is
given by a part model's XML attributes. A spatial state model may know about
the \emph{position} and \emph{size} of its parts, in space. A temporal model
(such as a workflow) may have to know about the \emph{position} of its parts in
time, in order to be able to execute them in the correct order. Further, the
temporal model needs to know about the \emph{input/output} (i/o) state models
which are to be manipulated by the corresponding logic operation (part model).
The number of parts within a whole (compound) model may be limited. And so on.
These additional information are provided by \emph{property} tags whose number
is conceptually unlimited.

Not only parts need additional meta data; properties may need such data, too.
The position or size as properties of a part may have to be constrained to
certain values, such as a \emph{minimum} or \emph{maximum}. The values of the
\emph{colour} property of a part model may have to be chosen out of a
pre-defined set called \emph{choice}. Data of that kind are stated in
\emph{constraint} tags.
