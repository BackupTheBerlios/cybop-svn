This chapter defines the \emph{Syntax}, \emph{Vocabulary} and \emph{Semantics}
of the CYBOL language.

As already mentioned in chapter \ref{introduction_heading}, CYBOL is based upon
\emph{two} kinds of hierarchies. One of them is representing \emph{Whole-Part}
relations (such as a graphical window consisting of a menu bar) and the other
the \emph{Meta Data} which a whole keeps about its parts (such as the size or
colour of the menu bar). More details and the philosophical background are
described in \cite{cybopbook}. The syntax and semantics of CYBOL as new
language must be rich enough to express abstract knowledge models using this
kind of double hierarchy.
