After having had a closer look at design patterns for persistence
(\emph{Data Mapper}) and communication (\emph{Data Transfer Object}), this
section considers the presentation layer of an application (figure
\ref{logical_figure}), which is often realised in form of a
\emph{Graphical User Interface} (GUI). Nowadays, the well-known
\emph{Model View Controller} (MVC) pattern \cite{buschmann, fowler2002} is used
by a majority of standard business applications. Its principle is to have the
\emph{Model} holding domain data, the \emph{View} accessing and displaying
these data and the \emph{Controller} providing the workflow of the application
by handling any action events happening on the view (figure \ref{mvc_figure}).
This separation eases the creation of applications with many synchronous views
on the same data. Internally, the MVC may consist of design patterns like:

\begin{figure}[ht]

        \caption{Model View Controller Pattern}
        \label{mvc_figure}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
    \item[-] \emph{Observer} (section \ref{observer_heading}) which notifies
        the views about data model changes
    \item[-] \emph{Strategy} \cite{gamma1995} which encapsulates exchangeable
        functionality of the controller
    \item[-] \emph{Wrapper} (section \ref{wrapper_heading}) which delegates
        controller functionality to the \emph{Strategy}
    \item[-] \emph{Composite} (section \ref{composite_heading}) which equips
        graphical views with a hierarchical structure
\end{itemize}

Some MVC implementations like parts of the \emph{Java Foundation Classes} (JFC)
use a simplified version not separating controllers from their views. The
\emph{Microsoft Foundation Classes} (MFC) C++ library calls its implementation
\emph{Document-View}.

Besides the above-mentioned patterns \emph{Data Mapper} and DTO, MVC is the
third one getting merged into a common \emph{Translator} architecture, in
chapter \ref{state_and_logic_heading}.
