Many state-of-the-art software systems consist of a layered architecture
similar to the one shown in figure \ref{logical_figure}. Yet how do the
communication patterns explained before suit this classical architecture? In
the traditional model of a layered software system, a startable process, best
placed in the \emph{Controller}, creates the whole application tree, to which
belong the \emph{Views} (as user interface), several \emph{Models} of the
\emph{Domain} (providing data to the views and as facade to remote servers) and
the \emph{Data Mapper} (translating between domain- and database model).

\end{figure}

It is not difficult to figure out where the communication patterns of section
\ref{basic_patterns_heading} fit in here (figure \ref{placement_figure}): The
\emph{Model View Controller} (\emph{Presentation Layer}) determines the parts
to interact with a human user via the \emph{View}; the \emph{Data Mapper}
pattern with its inherent \emph{Entity Relationship Model} (ERM) encapsulates
mechanisms to connect to a persistence medium such as a \emph{Database} (DB);
the \emph{Data Transfer Object} (DTO) and its corresponding assemblers,
finally, serve as means of communication with remote servers.
