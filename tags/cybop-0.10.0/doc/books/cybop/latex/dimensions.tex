\paragraph{Dimensions}
\label{dimensions_heading}
\index{Dimensions}
\index{Time as Dimension}
\index{Space as Dimension}
\index{Mass as Dimension}

\emph{Time} is usually expressed as scalar product of \emph{one} quantity and
one unit. \emph{Space} is represented by \emph{three} such values. It would be
interesting to know if \emph{Mass} could possibly fill the gap in this order and
be the one to be measured in \emph{two} values. Latest research shows that
\emph{Gravitation} has probably a lot to do with \emph{Geometry}. Why not so
\emph{Mass} as part of the definition of \emph{Force}?

Are there other dimensions, besides time and space, in this order?
