Finally, there are standardisation activities in the \emph{Open Source Software}
(OSS) community. Just recently, the \emph{Healthcare Xchange Protocol} (HXP)
\cite{hxp} was defined by a number of projects.

HXP is a data exchange protocol to be used by healthcare applications to
communicate transparently with each other, regardless of their corresponding
platform. The aim is to make data exchange simple to implement, easy to
understand, flexible, reliable, secure, free, and more. HXP is based upon the
XML \emph{Remote Procedure Call} (RPC) open standards specifications, that is
it uses messages in XML format for communication.

The specification and all documentation are open and everybody can contribute
ideas.
