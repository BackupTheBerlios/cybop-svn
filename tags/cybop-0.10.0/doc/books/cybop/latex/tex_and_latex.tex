The special-purpose \TeX\ \cite{tex} language is the centre-piece of a
typesetting system which, due to its well-formatted output of complex
mathematical formulas and generally high-quality typesetting, is especially
popular among academic circles of mathematicians, physicists and computer
scientists \cite{latextutorial}. The Wikipedia encyclopedia \cite{wikipedia}
writes:

\begin{quote}
    \TeX\ is a macro and token based language: many commands, including most
    user-defined ones, are expanded on the fly until only unexpandable tokens
    remain which get executed. Expansion itself is practically side-effect free.
    Tail recursion of macros takes no memory, and if-then-else constructs are
    available. \ldots

    The \TeX\ system has precise knowledge of the sizes of all characters and
    symbols, and using this information, it computes the optimal arrangement of
    letters per line and lines per page. It then produces a \emph{Device Independent}
    (DVI) file containing the final locations of all characters. The DVI file
    can be printed directly given an appropriate printer driver, or it can be
    converted to other formats.
\end{quote}

The \emph{PDFTeX} translator program is often used to bypass all DVI generation,
by creating \emph{Portable Document Format} (PDF) files directly.

Nowadays, \TeX\ is mostly used with a template extension called \emph{Lamport \TeX}
(\LaTeX, \LaTeXe) \cite{latex}. The Indian \emph{\TeX\ Users Group} (TUG) writes
\cite{latextutorial}: \textit{\LaTeX\ is a document preparation system which
adds a set of functions that make the \TeX\ language friendlier than using
the primitives provided by it.} It offers programmable \emph{Desktop Publishing}
(DTP) features and extensive facilities for automating most aspects of
typesetting. \cite{wikipedia}

The most important feature of \TeX\ for this work is its kind of relating meta-
with structural information. Two examples may help here:

\begin{scriptsize}
    \begin{verbatim}
    \documentclass[a4paper,12pt]{book}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{path/file.pdf}
    \end{verbatim}
\end{scriptsize}

The first statement determines \emph{book} as document class for a document to
be written. It contains additional information such as paper- and font size, in
square brackets. The second statement refers to a graphics file to be included.
The additional information given in square brackets here is the scale factor.
With a different syntax, but in a comparable manner, the knowledge modelling
language introduced in chapter \ref{cybernetics_oriented_language_heading} does
relate structural- with meta information.
