It is a well-known fact that many small requests between two processes, and
even more between two hosts in a network need a lot of time. A local machine
with two processes has to permanently change the \emph{Program Context}; a
network has a lot of \emph{Transfers}. For each request, there is a necessity
of at least \emph{two} transfers -- the \emph{Question} of the client and the
\emph{Answer} of the server. Transfer methods are often expected to deliver
common data such as a Person's address, that is surname, first name, street,
zip-code, town and so on. These information is best retrieved by only
\emph{one} transfer call. That way, the client has to wait only once for a
server response and the server does not get too many single tasks. All address
data (in this example) would best be packaged together and sent back to the
client.

A scenario of that kind is exactly what the \emph{Data Transfer Object} pattern
\cite{fowler2002} proposes a solution for: A central \emph{Assembler} object
takes all common data of the server's domain model objects and assembles them
together into a special \emph{Data Transfer Object} (DTO), which is a flat data
structure (figure \ref{dto_figure}). The server will then send this DTO over
network to the client. On the client's side, a similar assembler takes the DTO,
finds out all received data and maps (disassembles) them to the client's domain
model. In that manner, a DTO is able to drastically improve the communication
performance.

Both, \emph{Data Mapper-} and DTO pattern translate one model into another. Due
to this similarity, chapter \ref{state_and_logic_heading} will try to merge
them into a common \emph{Translator} architecture.
