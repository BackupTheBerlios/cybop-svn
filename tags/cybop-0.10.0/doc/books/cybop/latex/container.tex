An object that got created through instantiating a class represents an
allocated area in a computer's memory which needs to be referenced in order to
be able to work with it, and to finally destroy it. The size of that area may
change \emph{dynamically}, depending on how the properties of the object are
manipulated. Primitive types like \emph{integer} or \emph{double} also reserve
memory space, only that the size of that space is \emph{not} dynamic; it is
pre-defined by the programming language, for each type. All
\emph{Structured- and Procedural Programming} (SPP) languages and some
\emph{Object Oriented Programming} (OOP) languages, like Java, offer standard
primitive types.

One way to store references to more than one dynamic element in memory, or
primitive data, is a \emph{Container}. Modern programming languages offer many
different kinds of containers. Figure \ref{container_figure} shows a
systematics of the Java container framework \cite{java}, as example, which gets
briefly introduced in the following paragraphs. Its main categories of
systematisation are \emph{Collection}, \emph{Map} and \emph{Tree}.

A similar library of container classes, algorithms and iterators exists for the
C++ programming language. It is called \emph{Standard Template Library} (STL)
\cite{stl} and it talks of \emph{Sequence} and \emph{Associative Container},
where Java says \emph{Collection} and \emph{Map}.
