Earth is a system, a biotope and its biological creatures, including human
beings, are systems, our society, institutions, families and their individuals
are systems, machines and computers are systems -- and software applications
are systems. Actually, almost everything in existence can be treated and
simulated as system.

A rather general definition \cite{wikipedia} describes a system as: \textit{an
assemblage of inter-related elements comprising a unified whole.} Systems are
in a steady exchange with their environment. Information systems, for example,
exchange data. Depending on their structure, relations and contents, these may
be called \emph{Knowledge}. From the view of a system, the data are called
\emph{Input} and \emph{Output}. The output of one system can become the input
for another.

A certain logic with special rules can be abstracted in form of a \emph{System}.
The system's logic causes its characteristic \emph{Behaviour}, that is the way
its \emph{Input} gets manipulated to produce a specific \emph{Output}.
