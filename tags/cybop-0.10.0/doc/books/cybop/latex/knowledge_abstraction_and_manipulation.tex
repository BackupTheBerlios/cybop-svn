\section{Knowledge Abstraction and -Manipulation}
\label{knowledge_abstraction_and_manipulation_heading}
\index{Knowledge Abstraction}
\index{Knowledge Manipulation}

Having shown the existence of state- and logic knowledge, not only in software

what is still missing is an overview of fundamental abstractions of state- as
well as logic knowledge, and a solution showing how both can be manipulated, in
a knowledge-based system.
