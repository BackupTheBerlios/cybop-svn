\subsection{Model Viewer}

Finally, it would be very helpful to have a tool displaying not just planned-,
but \emph{real} runtime statuses of the knowledge model tree, in other words a
\emph{live} memory snapshot displayed in a meaningful, hierarchical form. Such
a \emph{Model Viewer}, as it might be called, would not only help in debugging
applications, but could be extended towards a runtime \emph{Model Editor},
allowing to move whole knowledge tree branches from one parent node to another.
