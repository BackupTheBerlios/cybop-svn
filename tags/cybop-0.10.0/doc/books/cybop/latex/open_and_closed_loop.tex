The scientific discipline of \emph{Automation-} and \emph{Control Engineering}
knows two kinds of control systems: \emph{Open Loop} and \emph{Closed Loop}
(\emph{Feedback}). German language better confines both by defining the terms
\emph{Steuerung} (stearing) and \emph{Regelung} (controlling). Figure
\ref{blackbox_figure} illustrates a closed loop system, received by adding a
feedback loop to the black box mentioned before.

\newpage

A device controlling the behaviour of a system is called a \emph{Controller}.
Automation engineering uses electronic components such as \emph{Capacitor} and
\emph{Coil} to build controllers providing \emph{linear} (proportional),
\emph{differential} or \emph{integral} behaviour. In software engineering,
things are simpler. A computer program containing special mathematical
equations can simulate and control a system.

A software system's internal signal processing loop reads signals one by one,
from a signal memory (section \ref{knowledge_management_system_heading}).
While processing them, new signals may get created and placed in the signal
memory. This is how output results may be fed back to become a new input to the
software system.
