A hierarchical object structure, also called \emph{Directed Acyclical Graph}
(DAG) or \emph{Tree}, can be represented by a combination of classes called
\emph{Composite} pattern \cite{gamma1995}. It describes a \emph{Component} that
may consist of \emph{Children} (figure \ref{composite_figure}), which makes it
comparable to the \emph{Whole-Part} pattern. The difference is that the
\emph{Composite} is a more generalised version, with a dynamically extensible
number of child (part) objects. The \emph{Composite} is a pattern based on
\emph{Recursion}, which is one of the most commonly used programming techniques
at all. The pattern's split into \emph{Leaf-} and \emph{Composite} sub classes
helps distinguish primitive- from container objects. A composite tree node
holds objects of type \emph{Component}.

The knowledge schema introduced in chapter \ref{knowledge_schema_heading} has
container capabilities, like the composite pattern. It does, however, not
distinguish between composite and leaf nodes, and not use inheritance.
