\subsection{Operation Execution}
\label{operation_execution_heading}
\index{CYBOI Operation Execution}

Each low-level operation has its own module, belonging to the \emph{Applicator}
part of CYBOI. An addition operation is executed in the \emph{add} module, a
comparison operation in the \emph{compare} module, a creation operation in the
\emph{create} module, and so forth. Operations exist for several purposes, some
of which are listed, together with an example operation, following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item[-] program flow (\emph{loop})
    \item[-] boolean logic (\emph{and})
    \item[-] comparison (\emph{equals})
    \item[-] arithmetics (\emph{add})
    \item[-] service control (\emph{startup})
    \item[-] memory management (\emph{create})
\end{itemize}
