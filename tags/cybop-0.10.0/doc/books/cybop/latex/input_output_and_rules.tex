In order to process data correctly, a system needs to know about their
\emph{Structure}. Software systems work with data belonging to some knowledge
model. Chapter \ref{knowledge_schema_heading} demonstrated how knowledge can be
modelled. Many applications keep their knowledge in special data files. Others,
such as \emph{Enterprise Resource Planning} (ERP) systems, retrieve their data
from a database. Even systems claiming to do nothing than pure data processing,
possibly using one operation only, rely on simple knowledge models, for at
least their \emph{Input/Output} (i/o) data.

Living systems rely on constantly exchanging information, energy, nutrients and
excretion products with their environment; they are never in a stationary, but
always in a \emph{Steady State}. A biological cell, for example, has inputs and
outputs and reacts in a certain manner which, after \cite{sengbusch}, is best
modelled with a \emph{Converter} containing \emph{Rules}, and treated as black
box. The cell's characteristic behaviour results from the way it relates inputs
to outputs.

        \label{manipulation_figure}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

Whilst figure \ref{blackbox_figure} illustrated the i/o flow of a system from
an \emph{outside} view, figure \ref{manipulation_figure} also considers the
state- and logic knowledge situated \emph{inside} a system. The arrow
indicating the information flow is directed from \emph{Logic-} towards
\emph{State} models, because the former manipulate the latter.
