\label{constructs_heading}
\index{CYBOL Constructs}

After having defined the CYBOL language in the previous section, the following
examples can demonstrate how the language's constructs may be used in practice.
Attention is also payed to how control structures of classical programming
languages (compare section \ref{structured_and_procedural_programming_heading})
may be implemented in CYBOL. Additionally, this section discusses how
inheritance, containers and software patterns were considered in the design of
CYBOL.
