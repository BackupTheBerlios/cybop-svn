\subsection{Hierarchical Algorithm}
\label{hierarchical_algorithm_heading}
\index{Hierarchical Algorithm}

Of course, algorithms, workflows and other activities over time can be
structured hierarchically as well.

To stick with the domain of medicine: A \emph{Medical Doctor}'s (MD) activity
is to \emph{Heal an Illness}. Part processes the MD has to carry out commonly
are to \emph{Diagnose}, to \emph{Treat} and to \emph{Prevent} an illness
(figure \ref{algorithm_figure}). Further structurings are possible. To the
process of diagnostics belong activities like \emph{Evaluate History} or
\emph{Examine Patient}.
