The previous sections demonstrated that there are many different ways to organise
a distributed information technology environment. The physical distribution of
systems is often a user requirement, either to connect different locations or to
reach better performance by sharing the work load. The degree to which a system
can be distributed to different hardware is often called its \emph{Scalability}.
Two models of scaling can be distinguished: \emph{vertical} and \emph{horizontal}
computing (figure \ref{scaling_figure}), whose key characteristics are only
described briefly here.

Vertical servers are large \emph{Symmetric Multiprocessing} (SMP) systems with
more than four \emph{Central Processing Units} (CPU) that share one common memory.
One single \emph{Operating System} (OS) instance covers the processors, the memory
and input/ output (i/o) components. Vertical servers provide high availability by
building numerous \emph{Reliability, Availability, Serviceability} (RAS) features
into the individual server, to minimise un-/planned downtime.

The alternative horizontal scaling connects many systems over network, which is
often called \emph{Clustering}. A cluster contains computing nodes having one to
four processors and a memory each. The input/ output devices may belong to just
one node or be shared by many. Each node has an OS instance. \textit{Horizontal
servers do not build RAS features into the individual servers but get high RAS
by replication and deployment of many servers}, as Atwood \cite{atwood} writes.

\end{table}

Table \ref{scalability_table} states some typical applications for vertical and
horizontal computing. The key difference, that after \cite{atwood} affected
both, their price and performance, is the \emph{Interconnect} used with each
architecture. Horizontal servers use a loosely-coupled \emph{external}
interconnect. Vertical servers use a tightly-coupled \emph{internal}
interconnect that makes data communications faster.
