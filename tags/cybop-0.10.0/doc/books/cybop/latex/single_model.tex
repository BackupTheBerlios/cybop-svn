Today, the most common design approach for standard application software is to
create a \emph{Single Model} of types whose semantics is often described in
form of an \emph{Entity Relationship-} (ER) or \emph{Object Oriented} (OO)
model,
%(section \ref{data_model_heading}),
the latter sometimes illustrated
using diagrams of the \emph{Unified Modeling Language} (UML).

\begin{figure}[ht]

        \caption{Single Model Approach (adapted from \cite{archetypes})}
        \label{single_figure}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

As example, figure \ref{single_figure} shows a UML \emph{Class Diagram} (CsD).
In its upper half, one can see a class \emph{Person} associated with the
classes \emph{Name} and \emph{Address}, as modelled at design time. They may be
part of a much larger model. The lower half of the figure shows the objects
(instances) at runtime, filled with concrete values. There are a number of
problems with this approach:

\input{inflexible_architecture}
\input{concept_mix}
\input{synchronisation_problems}
\input{complicated_processing}
\input{steady_upgrading}
\input{no_standardisation}
