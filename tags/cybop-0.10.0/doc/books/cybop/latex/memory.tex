The application/ domain knowledge a control software processes resides in a
\emph{Memory}. Two different kinds known from \emph{Informatics} are the
\emph{persistent} and \emph{transient} (\emph{volatile}) memory (section
\ref{persistent_and_transient_heading}). For the system architecture
investigated in this section, the term \emph{Memory} does not refer to
hardware, but to a special data structure for knowledge storage.

Section \ref{short_and_long_term_memory_heading} introduced the
\emph{Sensory Memory}, \emph{Long Term Memory} (LTM) and \emph{Short Term Memory}
(STM), so labelled by the science of psychology. Sensory memory stores data
arriving from input organs; LTM stores past contents; STM holds temporary
information to be processed within the system. A knowledge-processing system
with human archetype -- such as the one proposed in this work -- needs to have
equivalents for all three of them. Figure \ref{system_figure} illustrates a
system based on four kinds of memory:

\begin{itemize}
    \item[-] Knowledge Memory (equivalent of LTM)
    \item[-] Signal Memory (equivalent of STM)
    \item[-] Internal Memory (program-internal data)
    \item[-] Input/ Output Memories (sensory data)
\end{itemize}

The \emph{Knowledge Memory} is represented by one single root node that is able
to keep knowledge hierarchies of arbitrary size. The \emph{Signal Memory} is
much the same as the \emph{Event Queue} in classical systems.
\emph{Internal Memory} and \emph{Input/ Output Memories} are helper memories
for storing system-internal parameters.
