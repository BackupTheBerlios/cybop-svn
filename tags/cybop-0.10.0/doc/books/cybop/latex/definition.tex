When defining a new language, several linguistic aspects have to be considered.
One way to systematise \emph{Language Analysis} as part of \emph{Linguistics}
is to stratify it \cite{odonnell} into the four fields:

\begin{itemize}
    \item[-] \emph{Context:} topic described by the language, relationships
        between discussants, channel of communication
    \item[-] \emph{Semantics:} meaning of language symbols and character strings;
        includes what is usually called \emph{Pragmatics} (\emph{Use} of language)
    \item[-] \emph{Lexico-Grammar:} syntactic organisation of words into utterances
    \item[-] \emph{Phonology-Graphology:} study of the sound system and its
        phonemes \cite{wordnet}; judging a person's character from his
        handwriting \cite{websters}
\end{itemize}

Many more (sub) fields like \emph{Orthography} and also other systematics
\cite{teachsam} exist that will not be considered further in this document.
\emph{Phonology} and \emph{Graphology} are not considered either, and the
\emph{Context} of CYBOL is very clear: It is to become a language for knowledge
modelling. The remaining fields \emph{Syntax} and \emph{Semantics} are
important for the definition of CYBOL and will get their own sections
following. Another point receiving attention is the language \emph{Vocabulary}
(\emph{Terms}) whose background in abstraction was discussed in sections
\ref{language_heading} and \ref{knowledge_abstraction_and_manipulation_heading}.

The CYBOP knowledge schema (section \ref{knowledge_representation_heading}) is
based upon two kinds of hierarchies, one representing \emph{Whole-Part}
relations and the other the \emph{Meta Information} which a whole keeps about
its parts. The syntax and semantics of CYBOL as new language must be rich
enough to express abstract models using these kinds of hierarchies.

Yet before inventing a completely new language definition, it seems useful to
make use of existing technologies and solutions. An interesting candidate is
the \emph{Extensible Markup Language} (XML), as introduced in section
\ref{extensible_markup_language_heading}.
