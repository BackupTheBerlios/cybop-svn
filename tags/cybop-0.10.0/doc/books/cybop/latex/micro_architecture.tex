The \emph{Micro Architecture} level contains a number of memories and the so
called \emph{Arithmetic Logic Unit} (ALU) which is an \emph{Integrated Circuit}
(IC) that is able to execute simple arithmetic operations. The arithmetic logic
unit and registers exchange data across the \emph{Data Path}. The data path is
controlled either directly by hardware or by a special \emph{Micro Program}
which interprets instructions from the next higher
\emph{Instruction Set Architecture} (ISA) level.
