\subsection{Distribution and Installation}

\index{CYBOI Distribution and Installation}

The current version of CYBOI, as well as already existing CYBOL applications,
are distributed in form of \emph{Debian GNU/Linux Packages} (DEB). Future
versions may be provided in \emph{RPM/ Red Hat Package Manager} (RPM) format as
well. Also, installation files for other OS like Windows might be available
then.

One question that had to be answered was where to put the CYBOI binary, but
also CYBOL application files in UNIX \emph{Filesystem Hierarchy Standard} (FHS)
\cite{fhs} directories. The \emph{/usr/bin} directory for CYBOI is obvious.
CYBOL files, on the other hand, are the source + executable + configuration of
an application, at the same time, all in one. A mailing list discussion
\cite[June 2005]{debiandevel} finally suggested a practicable way, namely to
put all CYBOL applications to the \emph{/usr/share/} directory.
