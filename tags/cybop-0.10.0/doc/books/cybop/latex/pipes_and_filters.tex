Systems that process streams of data may make use of the \emph{Pipes and Filters}
pattern \cite{buschmann}. It encapsulates every processing step in an own
\emph{Filter} component and forwards the data through channels which are called
\emph{Pipeline} (figure \ref{pipesfilters_figure}). The data forwarding can
follow various scenarios:

        \label{pipesfilters_figure}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
    \item[-] \emph{Push:} active filter pushes data to passive filter
    \item[-] \emph{Pull:} active filter pulls data from passive filter
    \item[-] \emph{Mixed Push-Pull-Pipeline:} all filters may push or pull data
    \item[-] \emph{Independent Loops:} all filters are active and access pipeline data
\end{itemize}

Families of related systems can be formed by changing the single filter
positions. Special communication filters are also used in the interpreter
program of chapter \ref{cybernetics_oriented_interpreter_heading}. Its filters
belong to neither of the above-listed forms of data forwarding, because they
are all passive, controlled from an outside entity which is not a filter
itself.
