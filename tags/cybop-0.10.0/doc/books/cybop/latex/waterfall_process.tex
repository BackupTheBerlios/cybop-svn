The \emph{Waterfall Process} (figure \ref{waterfall_figure}) is the classical
way to develop a product. It assumes that the requirements are clear and do not
change during a project. Waterfall software development is pretty straightforward
and usually consists of the sequenced phases \emph{Requirements}, \emph{Analysis},
\emph{Design}, \emph{Implementation} (Realisation, Coding), \emph{Test} and
\emph{Integration} (Release).

Numerous variations of waterfall processes exist. The simplest ones deliver
their product at once, at the end of the project, what is often called
\emph{Big Bang Delivery} \cite{malotaux}. Others integrate some kind of
\emph{Back Flow} \cite{sweedyk} that allows to consider test results in further
development. One example that has combined software development- and testing
activities is the \emph{V-Modell 97} \cite{vmodel} (figure \ref{vmodel_figure}).
Its name stands for its shape: the left-hand (downhill) side of the \emph{V}
represents the development; the right-hand (uphill) side represents the
corresponding test activities.
