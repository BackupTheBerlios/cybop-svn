The \emph{Layers} pattern \cite{buschmann} is one of the most often used
principles to subdivide a system into logical levels. One variant was shown in
figure \ref{logical_figure}, at the beginning of this chapter. It contained the
three layers \emph{Presentation}, \emph{Domain Logic} and \emph{Data Source}. A
more general illustration can be seen in figure \ref{layers_figure}. It shows a
client using the functionality encapsulated in a layer. That top-most layer
delegates subtasks to lower-level layers which are specialised on solving them.
Another well-known example making use of this pattern is the \emph{ISO OSI}
model as introduced in section \ref{systems_interconnection_heading}.

One variant of this pattern, mentioned by Buschmann \cite{buschmann}, is the
\emph{Relaxed-Layered-System}. It permits a layer to not only use the services
of its direct base layer, but also of yet lower-situated layers. The base layer,
in this case, is called \emph{transparent}.

The ontology examples in chapter \ref{knowledge_schema_heading} are organised
according to the \emph{Layers} pattern. Their layers represent levels of
growing granularity.
