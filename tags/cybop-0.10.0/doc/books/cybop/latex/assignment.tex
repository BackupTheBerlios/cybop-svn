A \emph{Statement} (figure \ref{statement_figure}) is a sequence of operators
and operands \cite{cmanual}, to be evaluated (executed) by (the next lower
abstraction level of) a computer. It is also called an \emph{Expression}. The
\emph{Operator} represents the actual \emph{Operation}, an active instruction
to the computer. It uses and works on passive data -- the \emph{Operands}, also
called \emph{Variables}. Following a statement in \emph{C} code:

\begin{scriptsize}
    \begin{verbatim}
    operand++;
    \end{verbatim}
\end{scriptsize}

\begin{figure}[ht]

        \caption{Statement as Program Flow Chart and Structure Chart}
        \label{statement_figure}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

A \emph{Variable} is a placeholder for an abstracted \emph{Data Value}. It
occupies space in memory which is why this space has to be reserved before it
can be used. The reservation is called \emph{Allocation} or \emph{Declaration}
and it states the variable's \emph{Type} and an \emph{Identifier}. Commonly,
variables also get initialised through the \emph{Assignment} of an
\emph{Initial Value}. Here an example for declaration and initialisation
through assignment in \emph{C} code:

\begin{scriptsize}
    \begin{verbatim}
    type identifier = value;
    \end{verbatim}
\end{scriptsize}

Many statements which belong together can form a \emph{Block}, also called
\emph{Compound Statement}. Variables declared in a block are called its
\emph{Local Variables} and loose their validity outside that block. Blocks have
an opening and a closing symbol. Following once more an example in \emph{C}
programming language source code, showing a block with two statements:

\begin{scriptsize}
    \begin{verbatim}
    {
        statement1;
        statement2;
    }
    \end{verbatim}
\end{scriptsize}
