\paragraph{Missing Methodology}
\label{missing_methodology_heading}

Standards specifications were not developed by any recognised engineering
\emph{Methodology}, often without any discipline whatsoever. Instead, they were
developed by \emph{ad hoc} argumentation in conference rooms, by whoever happens
to turn up, with whatever skills (often many skills, but few relevant ones).
Sometimes, whoever shouted the loudest would win.
