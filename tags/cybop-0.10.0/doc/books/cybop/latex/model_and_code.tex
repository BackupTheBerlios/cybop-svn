The knowledge abstraction- and implementation techniques considered in the
previous sections belong to the current state-of-the-art in software design and
-modelling, with focus on \emph{Domain Engineering} (DE). Despite some
exceptions like the \emph{Feature Model} (section \ref{feature_model_heading}),
which supports the mapping between abstractions of the analysis- and design
phase, most described techniques deal with bridging the gap between design
models and source code.

Alan Brown writes \cite{brown2004}: \textit{One useful way to characterise current
practice is to look at the different ways in which the models are synchronized
with the source code they help describe.} Figure \ref{modelcode_figure} shows
the spectrum of modelling approaches in use today. The different categories
\cite{brown2004} are:

\input{code_only}
\input{code_visualisation}
\input{roundtrip_engineering}
\input{model_centric}
\input{model_only}

Considering the developments of the last decades but especially recent years,
the modelling trend clearly goes \emph{left-to-right}, with respect to figure
\ref{modelcode_figure}, that is from \emph{Code only-} to more \emph{Model-centric}
approaches. The emerge of the \emph{Model Driven Architecture} (MDA) (section
\ref{model_driven_architecture_heading}) is one sign therefore. Yet although
these efforts certainly contribute to easier and faster development, less
inter-dependencies within systems, better documentation and clearity of source
code, improved maintenance and more -- the gap between \emph{Design-} and
\emph{Implementation} phase, within a \emph{Software Engineering Process} (SEP)
(chapter \ref{software_engineering_process_heading}), remains. By introducing a
new knowledge schema (chapter \ref{knowledge_schema_heading}), this work wants
to conclusively close gap number \emph{2} (with respect to figure
\ref{gaps_figure} of section \ref{abstraction_gaps_heading}) and provide a
model-only approach.
