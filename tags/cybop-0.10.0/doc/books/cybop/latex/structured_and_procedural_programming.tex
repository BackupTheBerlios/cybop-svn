Computer history has produced a whole plethora of high-level languages (an
overview is given in section \ref{language_history_heading}). They are to ease
the programming of applications which solve problems of an arbitrary domain.
Nearly all of them make use of a number of techniques that stem from the
so-called \emph{Structured- and Procedural Programming} (SPP).

These techniques arise from firstly the reduction of \emph{Control Structures} to a
minimal set of elements which can be combined arbitrarily in \emph{Sequenced Steps}.
Secondly, repeating algorithms can be defined as \emph{Procedure} and called as
subroutine. That way, wild \emph{Jumps} from one part of a program to another
are avoided. A procedure can also call itself which is known as \emph{Recursion}
\cite{philippow}.

It is possible to \emph{hierarchically modularise} all control structures, with
each structure having a defined \emph{Entrance} and \emph{Exit}. When
procedures are grouped together in a separate file, then this file is often
called \emph{Module} or \emph{Library}. Modules can contribute greatly to the
reuse and creation of clear program code.

Two kinds of diagrams are typically used to describe a (part of a) procedural
program semi-formally: \emph{Program Flow Chart} and \emph{Structure Chart}.
Both representations are based on sequences of control structures. The former
differs from the latter in the existence and appearance of certain graphical
elements; \emph{GoTo} instructions, for example, do not exist in structure
charts.

Following is a brief description of the most important control elements of SPP,
given in form of both, diagrams \cite{schiedermeier} and C program code
\cite{gcc}. These basic control techniques are: \emph{Assignment},
\emph{Branching} and \emph{Looping}.
