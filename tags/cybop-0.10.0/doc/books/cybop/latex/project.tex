The -- somewhat idealistic -- aim was initially to create the prototype of a
\emph{Hospital Information System} (HIS). Due to the clearly too high-set aims,
this was later revised so that the focus of the prototype became a standard
\emph{Practice Management System} (PMS) with an \emph{Electronic Health Record}
(EHR) as its core. Several technology changes during the progress of this work
and the lack in time required to also revise this aim, so that now the final
prototype consists of just the (rudimentary) address management module of the
planned EHR application. It is written in CYBOL and executable by CYBOI.

The following sections describe the project background of \emph{Res Medicinae}.
