\index{Synchronisation Problems}

The mix of application knowledge with system control software also causes
synchronisation (communication) problems within software development projects.

first understand domain knowledge before being able to correctly implement it
into software. Experts bring their knowledge into a more software-friendly
form, during analysis.
