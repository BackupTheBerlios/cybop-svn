        Two Things are needed to do our Work:\\
        tireless Endurance and the Willingness to throw something,\\
        that has cost much Time and Effort, away again.

The previous chapter described how the CYBOP concepts introduced in part
\ref{contribution_heading} of this work can be implemented in a formal language
carrying the abbreviated name CYBOL. The now still missing piece is a program
able to dynamically handle static CYBOL sources, as mentioned in chapter
\ref{statics_and_dynamics_heading}. This chapter therefore describes the
\emph{Cybernetics Oriented Interpreter} (CYBOI) \cite{cybop} which can do just
that.
