Tanenbaum and Steen \cite{tanenbaum2002} define a \emph{Distributed System} as
\textit{a collection of independent computers that appear to its users as a
single coherent system}. With \emph{System} referring to a process rather than
only hardware, as defined in section \ref{process_heading}, it seems appropriate
to rephrase and use this for the definition of a general
\emph{Distributed Computing Environment} (DCE):

\begin{quote}
    A distributed computing environment consists of at least two systems that
    work together over a network but run on independent computer hardware (nodes).
\end{quote}

\begin{figure}[ht]

        \label{peer_figure}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

Besides the previously mentioned client/ server (c/s) environments, so-called
\emph{Peer-to-Peer} (P2P) computer networks latterly became popular. In them,
nodes do not have just one role, but act as client and server at the same time
(figure \ref{peer_figure}), thus sharing their computing power and bandwidth.
Common P2P protocols are: \emph{Freenet}, \emph{Gnutella2}, \emph{BitTorrent},
\emph{eDonkey}, \emph{FastTrack} or \emph{Napster} \cite{wikipedia}. Many more
exist.

Just like nodes in a P2P network, human beings are capable of communicating
both ways, taking the role of a client or server. The organs that are needed to
do so are put into comparison with the corresponding devices of a computer
system, in chapter \ref{state_and_logic_heading}.
