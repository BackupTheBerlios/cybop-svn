The DAML+OIL language resulted from a combination of the DAML and OIL languages.
The \emph{DARPA Agent Markup Language} (DAML) \cite{damloil} was created in a
project run by the \emph{Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency} (DARPA) of the
\emph{United States of America} (USA); the \emph{Ontology Inference Layer} (OIL)
was created within the \emph{Information Science Technologies} (IST) program of
the \emph{European Union} (EU) \cite{rdfowlrelease}. Both projects aimed at
developing a language and tools to facilitate the concept of the
\emph{Semantic Web} (section \ref{semantic_web_heading}).

At the beginning of the project stood the realisation that: \textit{The use of
ontologies (section \ref{conceptual_network_heading}) provides a very powerful
way to describe objects and their relationships to other objects.} The DAML+OIL
language, being developed as an extension to the \emph{Extensible Markup Language}
(XML) (section \ref{extensible_markup_language_heading}) and the
\emph{Resource Description Framework} (RDF) (section \ref{semantic_web_heading}),
therefore provided a \cite{rdf} rich set of constructs with which to create
ontologies and to markup information so that it becomes machine-readable and
understandable. Much of the work in DAML and OIL has now been incorporated into
OWL (section \ref{web_ontology_language_heading}).

Chapter \ref{cybernetics_oriented_language_heading} will introduce a language
that is based on XML, too.
