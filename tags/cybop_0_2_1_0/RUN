RUN


- currently, only one small system is working as demonstration;
it can be started, a graphical frame will be shown and can be shutdown again
- to startup the system, open a console window
- in that console window, type the following commands:

cd /home/cybop
./bin/startup_cyboi.sh startup cybol/res_medicinae/res_medicinae

- when the system is started, one can see a frame with menu
- when moving the mouse, those signals are caught and produce an output
  in the console window
- when clicking about 1 cm from the top and 1 cm from the left,
  the system should shutdown (exit) properly
  (the menu is a dummy; in reality, the mouse coordinates are read)

- that is all, for now.
- we could fastly produce more and nicer windows, if not depending
  on the java swing toolkit anymore
- perhaps you know and would like to work with us on new graphics
  drawing operations which probably requires some knowledge of C, X, Gtk
