Hi Christian,

The JavaWorld editors met recently to discuss your article submission.
Unfortunately, we have decided not to pursue your proposal. Please
understand that we receive a very large number of submissions, and we are
limited in what we can publish.

Thank you for your interest in writing for JavaWorld.

Best regards,
Carolyn

Subject: Article: "A new Concept for System Communication"


> Title:
> A new Concept for System Communication
>
> Word Count:
> 2800-3000
>
> Mission/Scope:
> Readers of this article will be able to better see similarities between
> different communication mechanisms, in the applications they currently
> work on. The article helps to understand essential architectural software
> patterns.
> (From Summary):
> Persistence, communication and user interface mechanisms have common
> properties. Classical system architectures treat them as Backend,
DataTransfer
> and Frontend and use different methods and design patterns (DataMapper,
> DataTransferObject, ModelViewController) to implement them.
> This paper proposes to sum up their common properties and behaviour in
parent
> classes and to merge them all into one architecture, avoiding redundant
parts.
> The resulting design is a good solution for the implementation of highly
> flexible, easily extensible and maintainable, reusable source code. The
> interdependency of domain data, persistence layer, communication layer and
> user interface is abolished.
> The time needed to create such an architecture (like in form of the CYBOP
> framework) is more than for the classical way. But once the architecture
is
> there -- it can save a tremendous amount of time when deriving modules
being
> capable of communicating across various mechanisms. Due to its flexibility
and
> low dependencies, it also ensures that extensions (e.g. new communication
> mechanisms) and modifications can be done anytime later without destroying
> already existing solutions.

> Sorry, I do not understand this requirement and what I should describe
here.

referenced.
>
> Abstract:
> This document describes how existing design patterns can be extended and
> combined to merge their advantages into one, domain- and
language-independent
> software framework. This framework, called Cybernetics Oriented
Programming
> (CYBOP), is characterized by flexibility and extensibility. Further, the
> concept of Ontology is used to structure the software architecture as well
as
> to keep it maintainable. A Component Lifecycle ensures the proper startup
and
> shutdown of any systems built on top of CYBOP.
> One core component of the framework is an advanced architecture for
seemless
> integration of communication paradigms and persistence mechanisms.
Overcoming
> the classical scheme of thinking in terms of Domain, Frontend, Backend and
> Communication, this architecture treats them all similar, as passive data
> models which can be translated into each other -- as opposed to the
classical
> approach that unnecessarily complicates their design.
> The practical proof of this combined architectural approach was
accomplished
> within an (ongoing) effort to design and develop a module called ReForm,
for
> the Open Source Software (OSS) project Res Medicinae. The main task for
this
> module is to provide a user interface for printing medical forms. It was
used
> to examine the communication between modules and to find a structure for
> effective implementation and easy expansion.

> Background/Biographical information:
> Christian Heller has studied Electrotechnics (Biomedical Engineering and
> Medical Informatics) at the Technical University of Ilmenau (TUI).
> He has worked in several projects at small to large-sized companies,
including
> OWiS (OTW UML tool), Intershop (e-commerce) and HUK Coburg (German
insurance
> company) where he did OO Analysis/ Design using UML and developed in
> ObjectPascal, C++ and Java.
> Besides, he is the founder of the "CYBOP Framework" and the "Res
Medicinae"
> Free Software Project -- aiming to implement a Medical Information
System --
> and active developer of the Free/ Open Source Software (FOSS) Community.
> In 2001, he returned to his former university where he plans to earn a
> doctorate.
