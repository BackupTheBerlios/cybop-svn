\subsection{Consistency}
\label{consistency_heading}

The described models are highly flexible and extensible and absolutely transparent
to the user (developer). S/he will not know whether the current communication is
with the local file system, a database or a remote process on another machine.\\
However, this transparency causes a number of problems. Surely, the most common
question is how to ensure consistency, security and minimum redundance?
The following two paragraphs give an answer to the first part of this question
-- consistency and uniqueness of data sets. Maximizing security and minimizing
redundancy have to be analysed in future works.
