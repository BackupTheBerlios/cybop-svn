\section{Hierarchy and Ontology}
\label{hierarchy_and_ontology_heading}

Section \ref{basic_patterns_heading} explained three design patterns that are
widely used in software architectures. It has shown similarities between them
and raised the question if they could possibly be merged into just one pattern,
called \emph{Translator}, what will be described in section
\ref{logical_architecture_heading}.
Yet before, this section will demonstrate how the principle of \emph{Hierarchy}
may be applied to obtain an \emph{Ontology}.
