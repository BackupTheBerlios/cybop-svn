\subsection{Three Tier Architecture}
\label{three_tier_architecture_heading}

To provide a more comfortable structure than the typical \emph{Two-Tier}
architecture as shown in section \ref{two_tier_architecture_heading}, there is
the necessity of a \emph{Three-} or \emph{Multi-Tier} Architecture.
If, for example, the location of the database server was changed then, in a
\emph{Two-Tier} architecture, all clients would have to be updated.
Figure \ref{three_tier_architecture_figure} makes a proposition to solve
this problem.
