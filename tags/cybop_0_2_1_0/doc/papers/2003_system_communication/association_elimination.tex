\subsection{Association Elimination}
\label{association_elimination_heading}

An \emph{Electronic Health Record} (EHR) will serve as example domain model whose class
structure is shown in part in figure \ref{parent_eliminate_child_associations_figure}.
It consists of numerous parts whereof at least two will be of type \emph{Address}
and \emph{Problem}, respectively. Following the \emph{Episode-based EHR}
recommendation \cite{westerhof}, \emph{Problem} may consist of \emph{Subjective}
and \emph{Objective}. All these associations between classes are needed to
navigate through the domain model.

A frequent design decision in object oriented programming is to sum up common
properties of sub classes by introducing a common super class. It is not only
properties, but also the \emph{Granularity} of objects that can lead to the
creation of a super class. The OpenEHR project \cite{openehr} suggests to let
the above-mentioned classes inherit from the more coarse-grained super classes
\emph{Record}, \emph{Unit}, \emph{Heading} and others.\\
Whichever reason -- once the super classes are there, they should be associated
similarly to their sub classes, that is in the same direction, using unidirectional
dependencies. Afterwards, all associations between sub classes become superfluous
as every sub class can reach its sibling across their parent classes' association
(figure \ref{parent_eliminate_child_associations_figure}).\\
Here a short Java code example for how the \emph{HealthRecord} may retrieve a
reference to \emph{Address}:
\begin{verbatim}
Address a = (Address) get("address");
\end{verbatim}
\emph{HealthRecord} inherits the \emph{get} method from its super class \emph{Record}.
\emph{Record} holds many instances of type \emph{Unit} and differing sub types.
The \emph{get} method delivers back an object that still needs to be down-casted
to the expected sub type \emph{Address}.\\
The definition of classes, their dependencies (defined by associations) and granularities
(defined by inheritance) in a software system results in several layers of classes of
common granularity, as shown in figure \ref{ontological_levels_and_item_container_figure}.
These layers are often called \emph{Ontological Level} as they form an \emph{Ontology}
(see section \ref{ontology_heading}).

\begin{figure}[ht]

        \label{ontological_levels_and_item_container_figure}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

Continuing the structure process of introducing more and more common, coarse-grained
or fine-grained super classes, the development culminates in one top-most super
class of all other classes in the system, which this paper calls \emph{Item}.
It is as general as the \emph{java.lang.Object} class for the Java class library,
only that it additionally represents a container that can store objects of any type,
as explained in \cite{hellerbohl}. In other words, \emph{Item} provides the meta
functionality of a container behaviour to \emph{all} other classes.
