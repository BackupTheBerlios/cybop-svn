\subsection{Translator Pattern}
\label{translator_pattern_heading}

As could be seen in section \ref{biological_reflections_heading}, there is always
a \emph{Translator} that is able to map domain model data to communication model
data (\emph{encode} method) and back (\emph{decode} method). Depending on which
communication medium is used, different translators need to be applied (figure
\ref{translator_classes_figure}).

\end{figure}

Every system has exactly one domain model but communication models of arbitrary
type can be added anytime (figure \ref{translator_accessing_models_figure}). Every
translator knows only how to translate between the domain model and a special
communication model. Direct translation between communication models is forbidden
as it would break the flexibility of the whole framework. In other words,
translations always have to be done \emph{via} the domain model.
