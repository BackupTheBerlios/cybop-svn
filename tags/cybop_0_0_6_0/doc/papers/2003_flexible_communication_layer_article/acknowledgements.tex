Our special thanks go to all Enthusiasts of the Open Source Community who have provided us with a
great amount of knowledge through a comprising code base to build on. We'd also like to acknowledge
the contributors of \emph{Res Medicinae}, especially all medical doctors who supported us with
their analysis work \cite{ch:analysedoc} and specialised knowledge in our project mailing lists.
Further on, great thanks goes to the Urban and Fischer publishing company, for providing anatomical
images from their \emph{Sobotta -- Atlas der Anatomie}.
