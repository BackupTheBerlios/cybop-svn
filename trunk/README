The CYBOP project comprises three elements:

1 Cybernetics Oriented Programming (CYBOP): a software development theory
2 Cybernetics Oriented Language (CYBOL): an application/ domain knowledge modelling language based on XML
3 Cybernetics Oriented Interpreter (CYBOI): an interpreter program written in ANSI C

Instructions on how to install cybop, compile cyboi and run cybol applications
are given in the file called INSTALL.
