Dear Christian HELLER,

Thank you for registering in SCI 2004. Your registration ID number is:
47401S. 

Receipts for all fees paid will be provided on check-in time at the
conference registration 
desk. 

The Conference Registration Office will post, on the Registration Status
web page, the confirmation of 
your registration. Please, check your registration status.

We would like to remind you that: 

* Registration fee includes: one (1) volume of the hard copy version of
the Conference Proceedings, 
a CD-ROM version of the Proceedings, coffee breaks and a welcome
reception. 

* Only one (1) paper will be published and included in the Conference
Program for presentation, for 
each registration fee.

* The registration fee does not include any post-conference services.
There will be additional 
shipping and handling costs to be paid for those registered authors who,
for unforeseen reasons, 
could not go to SCI 2004 and, after the Conference, will ask us to send
them the proceedings. Any 
post-conference administrative requirements will be charged at a rate of
US$20 per staff hour 
required to elaborate such a requirement, with a minimum of US$10.
Post-conference requirements 
will have their own deadline, which, in no case, will be more than three
(3) months counted 
from the last day of the Conference.

* All refund requests must be in writing and postmarked no later than
May 15th, 2004. No e-mail 
requests will be processed. A cancellation fee of US$50 will be applied.
Request for refunds 
postmarked after May 15th, 2004 will not be accepted.

* No-shows are not refundable and are liable for the full registration
fee. 

* Registration may be transferred to a colleague by giving him/her a
signed written authorization. 
It may be faxed to +1 (407) 856-6274 or it may be brought on check-in
time at the conference 
registration desk. Since we cannot securely receive the signature or
other authentication 
information, through e-mail, we cannot accept transfer of registrations
via e-mail. 

* The conference organizers cannot accept liability for personal
injuries, or for loss or damage 
to property belonging to conference delegates (or their accompanying
persons), either during or 
as a result of the conference. Please check the validity of your own
insurance. 

For additional information about the registration consult, please, the
Registration Guide published 
in the web site of the Conference.

Details of your registration appear below. Please save this e-mail as a
confirmation of your 
registration.

Thank you for registering.

We look forward to see you at the Conference!
