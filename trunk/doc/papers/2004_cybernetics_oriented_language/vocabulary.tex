\subsection{Vocabulary}
\label{vocabulary_heading}

XML allows to define and exchange the whole vocabulary of a language. It offers
two ways in which a list of legal elements can be defined: The traditional
\emph{Document Type Definition} (DTD) and the more modern \emph{XML Schema
Definition} (XSD). Besides the vocabulary, DTD and XSD define the structure of
an XML document and allow to typify, constrain and validate items. The CYBOL DTD
and XSD can be found at \cite{cybop}.
