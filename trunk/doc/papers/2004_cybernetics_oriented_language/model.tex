\subsection{Model}
\label{model_heading}

A theoretical \emph{Model} is an abstract clip of the real world, and exists in
the human mind. Another common word for \emph{Model} is \emph{Concept}.
It is the subsumption of \emph{Item}, \emph{Category} and \emph{Compound},
resulting from the three activities of abstraction: \emph{Discrimination},
\emph{Categorization} and \emph{Composition}. As such, each model knows about
its super model and the parts it consists of (figure \ref{abstract_model_figure}).
Software developers would call the illustration of these relations a \emph{Schema}
or \emph{Meta Model}.
