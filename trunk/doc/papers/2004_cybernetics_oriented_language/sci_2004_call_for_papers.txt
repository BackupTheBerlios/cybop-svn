Dear Dr. Christian  Heller:

We are sorry to take a bit of your valuable time, however, we think it
would be very important for you to be informed that we have extended both
the paper submission and the acceptance notification deadlines for SCI
2004. Consequently, we are sending you once again the invitation to
participate in SCI 2004 and the respective Call for Papers, as follows.

On behalf of the SCI 2004 Organizing Committee, I would like to invite you
to participate in the Eighth World Multi-Conference on Systemics,
Cybernetics and Informatics, which will be held in Orlando, Florida, USA,
from July 18-21, 2004.

Therefore, I am sending you the respective Call for Papers. The best 10% of
the papers will be published in SCI Journal
(http://www.iiisci.org/Journal/SCI/Home.asp), the hard copy version of
which will be ready in about one month, and it will be sent to the largest
university libraries.

We are making emphasis on the area of applications of informatics on
science and engineering , mainly Applications in Biology and Medicine which
is related to your specific area.

I would also like you to consider the possibility of organizing an invited
session related to a topic of your research interest. Organizers of the
best invited sessions will be co-editors of the proceedings volume where
their sessions' papers were included and of the CD electronic proceedings.
They will also be candidate for invited editors, or co-editors of a
possible SCI journal issue related to their invited session papers.

You can find information about the suggested steps to organize an invited
session in the Call for Papers and in the conference web page
http://www.iiisci.org/sci2004/ or http://www.iiis.org/sci2004.

If by any reasons you are not able to access the page mentioned above,
please, try the following pages: http://www.iiisci.org/sci2004/ or
