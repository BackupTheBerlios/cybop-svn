\paragraph{Composite}
\label{composite_heading}

A hierarchical object structure, also called \emph{Directed Acyclical Graph}
(DAG) or \emph{Tree}, can be represented by a combination of classes called
\emph{Composite} pattern \cite{gamma1995}. It describes a \emph{Component} that
may consist of \emph{Children} (figure \ref{composite_figure}), which makes it
comparable to the \emph{Whole-Part} pattern. The difference is that the
\emph{Composite} is a more generalized version, with a dynamically extensible
number of child (part) objects.

The \emph{Composite} is a pattern based on \emph{Recursion}, which is one of
the most commonly used programming techniques at all. The pattern's split into
\emph{Leaf-} and \emph{Composite} sub classes helps distinguish primitive- from
container objects. A composite tree node holds objects of type \emph{Component}.
