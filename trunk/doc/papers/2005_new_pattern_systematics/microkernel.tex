\paragraph{Microkernel}
\label{microkernel_heading}

The \emph{Microkernel} pattern \cite{buschmann} allows to keep a system flexible
and adaptable to changing requirements or new technologies. A minimal functional
\emph{Kernel} gets separated from extended functionality. The kernel may call
internal- or external servers (figure \ref{microkernel_figure}) to let them
solve special tasks which do not belong to its own core responsibility. Internal
servers are often called \emph{Daemons}.

        \label{microkernel_figure}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

This pattern provides a \emph{Plug \& Play} environment and serves as base
architecture for many modern \emph{Operating Systems} (OS). Andrew S. Tanenbaum
recommends its use as well \cite{tanenbaum2001}.
