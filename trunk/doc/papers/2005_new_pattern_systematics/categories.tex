\subsection{Categories}
\label{categories_heading}

Most patterns heavily rely on associations, too. This paper therefore suggests to:

\begin{center}
    \textbf{Take the Kind of Association as Criterion\\
    to sort patterns in a completely new way.}
\end{center}

The opposite table shows a systematics of the new pattern categories with their
equivalents in human thinking, some representative example patterns and a
recommendation for their usage in software engineering. Patterns matching into
more than one category are placed after the priority: \emph{Recursion} over
\emph{Polymorphism}.
