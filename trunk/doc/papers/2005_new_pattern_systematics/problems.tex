\section{Problems}
\label{problems_heading}

This section does not describe further patterns. Instead, it wants to come back
to reflective- and other mechanisms as described in section \ref{pattern_heading}

the following three reviews concentrates on the example of \emph{Java}, many
points surely count for other \emph{Object Oriented Programming} (OOP) languages
as well.
