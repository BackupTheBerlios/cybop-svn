\paragraph{Counted Pointer}
\label{counted_pointer_heading}

The \emph{Counted Pointer} pattern \cite{buschmann} supports memory management
in the \emph{C++} programming language, by counting references to dynamically
created objects (figure \ref{pointer_figure}). That way, it can avoid the
destruction of an object through one client, while still being referenced by
other clients. Also, it helps avoiding memory leaks by cleaning up forgotten
objects.
