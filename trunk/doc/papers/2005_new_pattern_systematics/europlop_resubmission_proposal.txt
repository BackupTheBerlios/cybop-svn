Dear Christian, Detlef and Ilka,

Thank you for your recent submission to EuroPLoP 2005.
The programme committee have now had time to review the
submitted papers and determine how many of each category
we have received.

The paper you submitted - A new Pattern Systematics - was
classified as a paper "about" or "using" patterns rather than
a pattern or pattern collection.

Unfortunately, this year we have not received enough papers
"about" or "using" patterns to form a workshop in their own right.
Because of this, we are unable to accept this paper for one of
the workshops at EuroPLoP. However, similar papers have been
successfully studied in previous years using the focus group
format. We would welcome it if you decided to re-submit the
paper for such a focus group.

If you decide to re-submit as a focus group then please let me
know. Otherwise I hope that you find a suitable forum for your
paper - maybe even at EuroPLoP next year.

Andy Longshaw
Programme Chair
EuroPLoP 2005
