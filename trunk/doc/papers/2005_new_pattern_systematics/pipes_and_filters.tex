\paragraph{Pipes and Filters}
\label{pipes_and_filters_heading}

Systems that process streams of data may use the \emph{Pipes and Filters}
pattern \cite{buschmann}. It encapsulates every processing step in an own
\emph{Filter} component and forwards the data through channels which are called
\emph{Pipeline} (figure \ref{pipesfilters_figure}). Families of related systems
can be formed by changing the single filter positions. The data forwarding can
follow various scenarios:

\begin{itemize}
    \item[-] \emph{Push:} active filter pushes data to passive filter
    \item[-] \emph{Pull:} active filter pulls data from passive filter
    \item[-] \emph{Mixed Push-Pull-Pipeline:} all filters push or pull data
    \item[-] \emph{Independent Loops:} all filters actively access pipeline
\end{itemize}
