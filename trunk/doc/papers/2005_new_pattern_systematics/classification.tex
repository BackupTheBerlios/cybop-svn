\subsection{Classification}
\label{classification_heading}

Several schemes of \emph{Pattern Classification} exist. One possible is shown in
figure \ref{pattern_figure}. Considering the level of abstraction (granularity),
it distinguishes between \emph{Architectural-}, \emph{Design-} and \emph{Idiomatic}
patterns \cite{buschmann}. Design patterns, in turn, are divided after their
functionality (problem category) into \emph{Creational-}, \emph{Structural-}
and \emph{Behavioural} patterns \cite{gamma1995}. The Wikipedia Encyclopedia
\cite{wikipedia} mentions three further problem categories: \emph{Fundamental-},
\emph{Concurrency-} and \emph{Real-time} patterns. Other criteria (dimensions)
of classification exist. Fowler introduces a completely different category which
he calls \emph{Analysis Patterns} \cite{fowler1997}. These are applicable early
in the \emph{Software Engineering Process} (SEP). And he defines patterns that
are more often used for describing the modelling \emph{Language} than the actual
\emph{Models} as \emph{Meta Model Patterns}.
