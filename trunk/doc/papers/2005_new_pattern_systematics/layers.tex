\paragraph{Layers}
\label{layers_heading}

The \emph{Layers} pattern \cite{buschmann} is one of the most often used
principles to subdivide a system into logical levels. One famous variant contains
the three layers \emph{Presentation}, \emph{Domain Logic} and \emph{Data Source}.
Another well-known example making use of this pattern is the
\emph{Open Systems Interconnection} (OSI) reference model, defined by the
\emph{International Organization for Standardization} (ISO). Numerous books
\cite{tanenbaum2000,payer} describe this model and its protocols.

A more general illustration can be seen in figure \ref{layers_figure}. It shows
a client using the functionality encapsulated in a layer. That top-most layer
delegates subtasks to lower-level layers which are specialized on solving them.

One variant of this pattern, mentioned by Buschmann \cite{buschmann}, is the
\emph{Relaxed-Layered-System}. It permits a layer to not only use the services
of its direct base layer, but also of yet lower-situated layers. The base layer
in this case is called \emph{transparent}.
