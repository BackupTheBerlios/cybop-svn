	4. Design patterns


Abstract:
Software patterns are a great aid in designing the
architecture of application systems. They provide
standard solutions for frequently occurring problems.

This paper introduces a new schema for systematizing
patterns. It arose from firstly, the investigation of
a whole spectrum of different patterns and secondly,
the application of the principles of human thinking
to the classification of these patterns.

This new way of sorting patterns uncovers their common
advantages but also disadvantages and may have the
potential to better support developers in choosing the
right pattern solutions for their problems.

Keywords. Software Design, Pattern Systematics,
Cybernetics Oriented Programming, CYBOP
