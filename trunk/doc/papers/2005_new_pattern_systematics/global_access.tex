\subsection{Global Access}
\label{global_access_heading}

A pure tree of instances in a computer's \emph{Random Access Memory} (RAM)
represents an unidirectional structure that permits data access along
\emph{well-defined} paths. Global access via static types, on the other hand,
allows \emph{any} instance to address data in memory \emph{directly}, which not
only complicates software development and maintenance, but, due to the
uncontrollable access, is a potential security risk.

The usage of static objects accessible by any other part in a system is an
\emph{Anti Pattern} to \emph{Inversion of Control} (IoC) \cite{avalon}, highly
insecure and hence undesirable.
