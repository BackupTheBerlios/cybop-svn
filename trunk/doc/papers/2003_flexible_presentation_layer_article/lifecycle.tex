\section{An Extended Component Lifecycle}

The CYBOP lifecycle of components is an extension of the lifecycle idea of Apache
-- basically the same idea but another background and realization.\\
All \emph{whole-part associations} between objects were organized
under the rules of the component lifecycle. Analogous to the
lifecycle of organic cells, the relations were created and
destroyed in a sequence of lifecycle steps. These steps are
realized as method calls on the components (see figure \ref{State
Diagram of CYBOB's Component Lifecycle}).
