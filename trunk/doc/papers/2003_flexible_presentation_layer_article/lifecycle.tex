\section{An Extended Component Lifecycle}
\label{an_extended_component_lifecycle_heading}

The CYBOP lifecycle of components is an extension of the lifecycle idea of Apache
-- basically the same idea but another background and realization.\\
All \emph{Whole-Part associations} between objects were organized under the rules
of the component lifecycle. Analogous to the lifecycle of organic cells, the
relations were created and destroyed in a sequence of lifecycle steps. These
steps are realized as method calls on the components (figure
\ref{component_lifecycle_figure}).
