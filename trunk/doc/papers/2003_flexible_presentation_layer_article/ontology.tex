\section{Ontology}
\label{ontology_heading}

An ontology is a catalogue of types that are depending on each other in hierarchical
order. It is a formal specification concerning a particular objective. CYBOP
consists of three such ontologies:
\begin{itemize}
    \item{Basic Ontology}
    \item{Model Ontology}
    \item{System Ontology}
\end{itemize}

Figure \ref{model_ontology_figure} shows the model ontology. The layer super types
are {\tt Record}, {\tt Unit}, {\tt Heading} and {\tt Description}. These classes
are super types of all classes in a particular ontological level.\\
The right side shows a concrete implementation of the model ontology -- the
\emph{Electronic Health Record} \cite{openehr}. This data structure contains all
information concerning a particular patient. The figure shows {\tt Problem} types
in level {\tt Unit}. These consist of episodes containing instances of
{\tt PartialContact}. In level {\tt Heading}, the structural elements of a partial
contact can be found -- {\tt Subjective}, {\tt Objective}, {\tt Assessment} and
{\tt Plan}. Therapeutical issues are placed in level {\tt Description} -- such as
{\tt Medication} with particular dose.

As shown, the concept of ontology can be used to organize data structures in
a hierarchical order by defining logical layers with super types.
