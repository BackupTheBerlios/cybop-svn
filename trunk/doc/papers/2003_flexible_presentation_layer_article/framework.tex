\section{CYBOP}
\label{cybop_heading}

Section \ref{design_principles_heading} introduced essential design patterns
that represent the main structure of the CYBOP framework. Section
\ref{an_extended_component_lifecycle_heading} explained the Component Lifecycle
and section \ref{ontology_heading} the well-known idea of ontology. Now these
design principles and conceptual architectures will be combined to comprise
their advantages and to increase the demanded quality characteristics: high
flexibility and maintainability.\\
\emph{Structure by Hierarchy} -- this is the basic idea behind CYBOP. Extending
the concept of Hierarchical Model-View-Controller to whole software architectures,
CYBOP was designed to be the domain-independent backbone for information systems
of any kind. Originally designed for medical purposes, it should also be usable
for insurance, financial or any other standard applications in future.

\subsection{Class Item}
\label{class_item_heading}

As shown, tree-like structures can be realized by the Composite pattern. In
CYBOP, this pattern can be found simplified in class {\tt Item} (figure
\ref{class_item_figure}) which is super type of all other classes. References,
respectively relations to child elements are held within a hashmap. No attributes
were used except of this hashmap. Every element of the map can be accessed by a
special key value. So, no particular {\tt get}- or {\tt set}-methods were needed
for attributes.

\subsection{Basic Structure}
\label{basic_structure_heading}

Comprising the design patterns \emph{Composite}, \emph{Layers}, and
\emph{Chain of Responsibility}, the CYBOP framework is comparable to a big tree
containing objects organized in different levels. Figure \ref{basic_structure_figure}
shows the object tree and the different levels of granularity.
