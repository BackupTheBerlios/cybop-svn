\section{CYBOP}
\label{cybop_heading}

Section \ref{design_principles_heading} introduced essential design patterns
that represent the main structure of the CYBOP framework. Section
\ref{an_extended_component_lifecycle_heading} explained the Component Lifecycle
and section \ref{ontology_heading} the well-known idea of ontology. Now these
design principles and concepts will be combined to comprise their advantages and
to increase the demanded quality characteristics: high flexibility and
maintainability.\\
\emph{Structure by Hierarchy} -- this is the basic idea behind CYBOP. While this
principle has been applied to many domain and knowledge models, especially in the
field of \emph{Artificial Intelligence} (AI), it apparently has not been used
for the design of systems yet.\\
Let us recall the \emph{Model View Controller} design pattern which is used in
one or another form by a majority of systems, today. There is a \emph{View} which
mostly is a \emph{Graphical User Interface} (GUI). It consists of for example a
frame, panel, menubar and smaller components which are all part of the frame's
hierarchy. Then, there is the \emph{Controller}. The \emph{Hierarchical MVC}
pattern suggested to use a controller hierarchy consisting of \emph{MVC Triads}.
Finally, there is the \emph{Model}. Not only AI systems use a \emph{Hierarchy}
to structure their domain data. The OpenEHR project \cite{openehr} does the same.\\
Reflecting these facts, one question is at hand: If view, controller and model
ideally have a hierarchical structure, why not creating whole software systems
after this paradigm? Isn't every system essentially a \emph{Tree} of objects?\\
Extending the concept of Hierarchical Model-View-Controller to whole software
architectures, CYBOP was designed to be the domain-independent backbone for
information systems of any kind. Originally designed for medical purposes, it
should also become usable for insurance, financial or other standard applications
in future.

\subsection{Class Item}
\label{class_item_heading}

As shown, tree-like structures can be realized by the Composite pattern. In
CYBOP, this pattern can be found simplified in class {\tt Item} (figure
\ref{class_item_figure}) which is super type of all other classes. References,
respectively relations to child elements are held within a hashmap. No attributes
were used except of this hashmap. Every element of the map can be accessed by a
special key value. So, no particular {\tt get}- or {\tt set}-methods were needed
for attributes.

\subsection{Basic Structure}
\label{basic_structure_heading}

Comprising the design patterns \emph{Composite}, \emph{Layers}, and
\emph{Chain of Responsibility}, the CYBOP framework is comparable to a big tree
containing objects organized in different levels. Figure \ref{basic_structure_figure}
shows the object tree and the different levels of granularity.
