\section{Record -- An EHR Module}
\label{record_an_ehr_module_heading}

The practical background for the application of CYBOP is \emph{Res Medicinae}
\cite{resmedicinae}. A modern clinical information system is the aim of all efforts
in this project. In future, it shall serve medical documentation, archiving,
laboratory work etc. \emph{Res Medicinae} is separated into single modules depending
on different tasks.\\
One of these modules is \emph{Record} -- an application for documenting medical
information (figure \ref{record_figure}). In addition to new documentation models,
it also contains a tool for topological documentation.

Starting from an overall view of the human body, it is possible to reach every
organ or region of the body in detail (figure \ref{topology_figure}).
