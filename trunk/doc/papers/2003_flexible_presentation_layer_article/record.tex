\section{Record -- An EHR Module}
The practical background for the application of CYBOP is \emph{Res Medicinae}.
A modern clinical information system is the aim of all efforts in this project.
In future, it shall serve medical documentation, archiving, laboratory work etc.
\emph{Res Medicinae} is separated into single modules depending on different tasks.\\
One of these modules is \emph{Record} -- an application for
documenting medical information (see figure \ref{Screenshot of
Record}). In addition to new documentation models,
it also contains a tool for topological documentation.\\
Starting from an over-all view of the human body, it is possible
to reach every organ or region of the body in detail (see figure
\ref{Excerpt from Topological Structure of Human Skeleton}).
