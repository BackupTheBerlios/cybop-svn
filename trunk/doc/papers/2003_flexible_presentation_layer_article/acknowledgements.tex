\section{Acknowledgements}
\label{acknowledgements_heading}

Our special thanks go to all Enthusiasts of the Open Source Community who have
provided us with a great amount of knowledge through a comprising code base to
build on. We'd also like to acknowledge the contributors of \emph{Res Medicinae},
especially all medical doctors who supported us with their analysis work
\cite{resmedicinae2001} and specialised knowledge in our project mailing lists.
Further on, great thanks goes to the Urban and Fischer publishing company, for
providing anatomical images from their \emph{Sobotta -- Atlas der Anatomie}.
