\subsubsection{Interacting Systems}
\label{interacting_systems_heading}

Figure \ref{communication_figure} shows a simplified example
\emph{Information Technology} (IT) environment (\emph{Physical Architecture}),
containing many interacting systems: server and client, local and remote, human
and artificial. In (object oriented) software design, special patterns are used
to architect a system such that it is able to communicate with other systems
across various mechanisms (\emph{Logical Architecture}). To these patterns
count the \emph{Data Mapper}, \emph{Data Transfer Object} and
\emph{Model View Controller} \cite{fowler2002}.

Although software development has become a lot easier in the last decades, it is
still a big effort that should not be underestimated. One thing that application
developers have to care about much of their time is the \emph{Conversion}
between various kinds of (communication) models that a system has:

\begin{itemize}
    \item[-] Frontend (with Human User)
    \item[-] Backend (with Data Source)
    \item[-] Remote (with Server)
    \item[-] Domain (with own Knowledge)
\end{itemize}

The different mechanisms and patterns that have to be considered for such model
conversion often need to be implemented repeatedly, for each new application.
Some trials to unify all backend communication in a common \emph{Persistence Layer}
exist \cite{ambler}, but are remote- and frontend communication seldom considered
in a comparable way. Obviously, no current effort treats the frontend as just
another communication model that has to be \emph{sent} to the human user as
just another system.
