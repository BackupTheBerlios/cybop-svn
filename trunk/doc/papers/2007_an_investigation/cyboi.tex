\subsection{CYBOI}
\label{cyboi_heading}

The pure existence of proper knowledge does not suffice to create an improved
kind of software system, within a slimmer software development process. The
system needs to know how to \emph{handle} knowledge, at runtime. The criticism
is twofold, since traditionally:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Operating systems don't have sufficient knowledge handling capabilities
    \item Applications contain too much low-level system control functionality
\end{enumerate}

This is changed when using CYBOI. As active interpreter encapsulating
system-level functionality, it handles knowledge provided in form of passive
CYBOL templates. In CYBOP systems, all compound knowledge models have the same
type structure (schema). Since they do not differ, they can be manipulated in
the same manner.
