\subsubsection{Functionality}
\label{functionality_heading}

Figure \ref{cyboi_figure} shows three main parts of CYBOI. (The \emph{Globals}
package is neglectable for the following explanations, since it contains static
constants and variables that are \emph{omnipresent}.) The \emph{Controller}
manages system startup, shutdown and the handling of signals during its
runtime; the system uses just one central signal checking loop. The
\emph{Memoriser} provides memory structures (to store knowledge) and procedures
to access these. Logic knowledge is processed in the \emph{Applicator}.
