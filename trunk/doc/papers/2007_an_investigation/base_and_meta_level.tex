\subsubsection{Base- and Meta Level}
\label{base_and_meta_level_heading}

Reflective techniques as described in \cite{heller2005} make use of one
so-called \emph{Base Level} and one or more \emph{Meta Levels}. The reason for
splitting a system's architecture in this way is the hope to be able to move
rather general \emph{System Functionality} into a meta level, while leaving
domain-specific \emph{Application Functionality} in the base level. (Well, in
his book \emph{Analysis Patterns -- Reusable Object Models} \cite{fowler1997},
Fowler used meta levels to model general classes containing not exclusively
system- but also domain-specific functionality.) The conflicts a design
decision of that kind can bring with were described in \cite{heller2005}, which
-- above all -- criticised the bidirectional dependencies.

However, what the proposition of reflective software patterns shows, is the
existence of a wish among software developers, to separate general system- from
more specific application functionality. And nature does exactly that. Yet
while reflective mechanisms use the same implementation techniques for system-
as well as for application-specific functionality, nature always treats passive
knowledge strictly separate from active system control. The best example
therefor is the biological cell division, where passive genetic information
situated in a \emph{Desoxy Ribo Nucleic Acid} (DNA) is read and transmitted
into proteins by an active mechanism involving \emph{Ribo Nucleic Acid} (RNA)
molecules \cite{heller2004}. Bidirectional dependencies do not exist between
the both.
