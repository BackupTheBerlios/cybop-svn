\begin{abstract}
This article reports about an effort trying to improve software system design
by applying to it concepts taken from other scientific disciplines. The
resulting programming theory differs from traditional ones. It is based on
firstly, a strict distinction of statics and dynamics, secondly a knowledge
schema structuring models and their meta information hierarchically, and
thirdly the separation of state- and logic knowledge. Many problems existing in
classical programming paradigms and languages are solved in this theory.\\
