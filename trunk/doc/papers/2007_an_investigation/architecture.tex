\subsubsection{Architecture}
\label{architecture_heading}

To what concerns its inner architecture, there are two basic structures
underlying CYBOI:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \emph{Knowledge Container:} An array-based structure usable for
        storing static knowledge in form of primitive- and compound models, and
        capable of representing a map, collection, list and tree
    \item \emph{Signal Checker:} A loop-based structure usable for dynamically
        reading signals from a queue, and capable of processing them after
        their priority, in a special handler
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[ht]

        \caption{CYBOI Architecture}
        \label{architecture_figure}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

All modules, into which CYBOI is subdivided, are built around these two core
structures. Not unlike John von Neumann's model of a computing machine
\cite{selflinux}, which distinguishes \emph{Memory}, \emph{Control Unit},
\emph{Algorithmic Logic Unit} (ALU) and \emph{Input/ Output} (i/o), CYBOI's
modules are grouped into four architectural parts, as illustrated in figure
\ref{architecture_figure}. These have the following functionality:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Memoriser:} data creation, -destruction and -access (after
        Neumann, it contains not only data, but also the operations that are
        applied to them)
    \item \emph{Controller:} lifecycle management, signal handling, i/o filters
    \item \emph{Applicator:} operation application (comparison, logic,
        arithmetic and more)
    \item \emph{Globals:} basic constants and variables, as well as a logger
\end{itemize}

The i/o data handling is not separated out here (as opposed to von Neumann's
model); it is managed by the controller modules. The i/o data themselves,
representing states, are stored in memory.
