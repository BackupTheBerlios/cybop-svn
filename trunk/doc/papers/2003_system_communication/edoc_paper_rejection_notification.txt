Dear Christian Heller,

thank you for your submission to EDOC 2003. Unfortunately, we have to inform
you that your paper

TITLE  : A flexible Software Architecture for Communication
AUTHORS: Christian Heller, Torsten Kunze, Jens Bohl, Ilka Philippow

could not be accepted.

We had to be quite selective, because the average quality of the submissions was exceptionally high this year. 

We appreciate your contribution and hope that the attached comments of the reviewers will help you to improve the quality of your paper.

We invite you to attend EDOC 2003 in September. The program will be published soon and sent to you by e-mail.

Best regards,

Maarten Steen & Barrett Bryant
EDOC 2003 PC Chairs

Summary: 
 			      This paper tries to propose a common abstract model for three situations currently found in software architecture: Backend, DataTransfer and FrontEnd.

Comments to the author: 
	      impossible to read data from Figure 5.
Figure 6 is not better.
Difficult to completely evaluate the paper in these conditions.

Section 8 (about the authors) need to be deleted.
An additional section about related work needs to be added.

The idea of building an abstract model of three situations commonly found in software architecture is much appealing. Two remarks however:
1. This is more a pattern paper than a classical EDOC paper. I would recommend sending it to a Pattern conference.

2. The paper stays much tool general. We need to have some concrete example of how the 3 schemes are performed.

Furthermore generalities like Fig. 4 should be skipped in this kind of conference paper.

Summary: 
 			      The paper describes a software framework and its application 
in an open source software project. The framework provides support
on persistence and communication pattern mappings. 

Comments to the author: 
	      - remove references from the abstract
- well done, in terms of applying existing knowledge
