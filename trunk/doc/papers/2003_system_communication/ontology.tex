\subsection{Ontology}
\label{ontology_heading}

Manifold definitions of the word \emph{Ontology} exist. They come from philosophy,
metaphysics, information technology and others -- too many to list here.
This document uses its own, adapted definition and considers an ontology to be
\emph{a strict hierarchy of abstract items, organized in levels of growing
granularity, that are solely unidirectionally related}. It such represents a
systematic description of complex domain contexts.

Figure \ref{electronic_health_record_ontology_figure} shows one possible ontology
of an electronic health record, as described in the previous section.
