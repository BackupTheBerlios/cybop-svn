\subsubsection{Schema}
\label{schema_heading}

A theoretical \emph{Model} is an abstract clip of the real world, and exists in
the human mind. Another common word for \emph{Model} is \emph{Concept}. It is
the subsumption of \emph{Item}, \emph{Category} and \emph{Compound}, resulting
from three activities of abstraction: \emph{Discrimination},
\emph{Categorisation} and \emph{Composition} \cite{heller2004}. Each model
\emph{knows} about the parts it consists of.

Yet what does this knowledge of a compound model (whole) about its parts imply?
Software developers call knowledge \emph{about} something
\emph{Meta Information}. Figure \ref{schema_figure} illustrates a
\emph{Schema} (structure) with four kinds of meta information in a whole-part
relation.

An obvious way is to give each part a unique \emph{Name} for identification.
Secondly, a compound needs to know about the \emph{Model} of each part since a
part may itself be seen as compound that needs to know about its parts. The
distinction of the several kinds of models, in other words the kind of
\emph{Abstraction} (compound, term, number etc.) of a model is the third kind
of information a compound needs to know about its parts. It is comparable to a
\emph{Type} in classical system programming languages. All further kinds of
meta information are summed up by a fourth relation which is called
\emph{Details}.
