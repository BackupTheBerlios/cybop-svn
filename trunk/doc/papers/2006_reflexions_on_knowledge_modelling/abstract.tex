\begin{abstract}
This article reports about an ongoing research investigating the possibilities
for applying inter-disciplinary concepts to software system design. The new
resulting programming philosophy is based on firstly, a distinction of statics
and dynamics, secondly a knowledge schema structuring models and their meta
information hierarchically, and thirdly the separation of state- and logic
knowledge. It solves many of the problems existing in classical programming
paradigms and languages and may have the potential to replace these in the long
run.\\
