Cybernetics Oriented Interpreter (CYBOI) for CYBOP
==================================================

CYBOI is the interpreter program needed to run systems written in
the CYBOL language. It can be seen as connection between the computer
hardware and the abstract data of CYBOL. A compilation is not
necessary to change and run CYBOL systems.
One mistake in current programming languages is the inheritance and
use of multiple kinds of containers and the wrong forwarding of 
signals/ events causing unnecessary dependencies. In CYBOI, there is
only one static and only one dynamic structure.

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code.

  2. `cd' to the directory /admin.
