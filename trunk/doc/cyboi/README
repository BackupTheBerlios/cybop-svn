Cybernetics Oriented Interpreter (CYBOI) for CYBOP
==================================================

CYBOI is the interpreter program needed to run systems written in
the CYBOL language. It can be seen as connection between the computer
hardware and the abstract data of CYBOL. A compilation is not
necessary to change and run CYBOL systems.
One mistake in current programming languages is the inheritance and
use of multiple kinds of containers and the wrong forwarding of 
signals/ events causing unnecessary dependencies. In CYBOI, there is
only one static and only one dynamic structure.


Basic Installation
==================

The simplest way to compile and install this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code.

  2. Type `make' to compile the package.
  
  3. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.

  4. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.

Requirements:
  depends: - to start cyboi You need libc6, xlibs, libxml2
           - to compile the source code You also need libxml2-dev
