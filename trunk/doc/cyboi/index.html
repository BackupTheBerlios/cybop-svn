            <h4>Cybernetics Oriented Interpreter (CYBOI)</h4>
            <p>
                CYBOI is the interpreter program needed to run systems written in
                the CYBOL language.
                It can be seen as connection between the computer hardware and the
                abstract data of CYBOL.
                A compilation of CYBOI is not necessary to change and run CYBOL systems.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the biggest disadvantages and mistakes in current programming languages
                is the inheritance and use of multiple kinds of containers and event loops.
                In CYBOI, there is only one static structure, the <i>array</i>, and
                only one global signal/ event <i>waiting loop</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
                CYBOI was originally written in Java using the Swing graphics toolkit.
                The next step will be to rewrite it in pure C so that CYBOI and CYBOL can
                be added as truely free software to the Debian GNU/ Linux Distribution.
                The only difficulty here is the choice of an appropriate graphics toolkit.
                Temporarily, Gtk, Qt or wxWindows may be used. In the long run,
                however, CYBOI will have to provide its own graphics drawing routines
                to make full use of the hierarchical structures encoded in CYBOL.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the future, CYBOI might get minimized so far (by moving data structures to CYBOL)
                that it could be implemented in Assembler/ Machine Language.
                Further on, CYBOL/ XML will be the only remaining programming language
                and even whole operating systems will be written in CYBOL only.
            </p>
