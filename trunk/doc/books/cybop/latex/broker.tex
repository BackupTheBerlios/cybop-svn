\subsubsection{Broker}
\label{broker_heading}
\index{Broker Pattern}
\index{Distributed Application}

The \emph{Broker} pattern \cite{buschmann} may support the creation of an IT
infrastructure for distributed applications. It connects decoupled components
which interact through remote service invocations (figure \ref{broker_figure}).
The broker is responsible for coordinating all communication, for forwarding
requests as well as for transmitting results and exceptions.

Chapter \ref{cybernetics_oriented_interpreter_heading} introduces an
interpreter program being able to act as broker.
