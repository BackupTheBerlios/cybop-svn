Finally, there is often a need to integrate \emph{Legacy Systems}, which are a
special variant of remote software systems running on computers with an older
architecture. Those computers are also named \emph{Host}, as in the example of
figure \ref{legacy_figure}, or \emph{Mainframe}. The applications running on
them are programmed in languages like the \emph{Common Business Oriented Language}
(COBOL) or \emph{Programming Language One} (PL/I) \cite{pli}, the latter
developed as an \emph{International Business Machines} (IBM) \cite{ibm} product
in the mid 1960's.

Host computers manage nearly everything an ancient information technology
environment needs. They are responsible for persistence and processing of data.
Often, they contain hierarchical databases \cite{oolegacysystems} using flat
files like the \emph{Virtual Storage Access Method} (VSAM) format. True clients
do not exist here. Character-based terminals are the way to communicate with
the host which controls all interaction (including keyboard and screen), within
a \emph{Third Party Maintenance} (TPM) \emph{Customer Information Control System}
(CICS) runtime environment.
