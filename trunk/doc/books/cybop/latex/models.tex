Section \ref{agent_oriented_programming_heading} described a (software)
\emph{Agent} as \emph{social} system communicating with other agents, including
human beings \cite[p. 330]{sowa}. Various communication process models were
contributed by the \emph{Social Sciences}. Buesch \cite{buesch} describes a
\emph{Mathematical Communication Model} by Shannon \& Weaver (figure
\ref{shannon_figure}) that shows very well the presence of two translators:
\emph{Encoder} and \emph{Decoder}.

        \label{shannon_figure}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

The \emph{Conversation Model} of Osgood \& Schramm (figure \ref{osgood_figure})
extends the communication model to a circular process of \emph{Question} and
\emph{Answer}, of \emph{Sending} and \emph{Receiving}. It shows more clearly,
that \emph{every} system, in order to communicate both ways, needs to own an
\emph{encoding} as well as a \emph{decoding} translator. The interpreter system
introduced in chapter \ref{cybernetics_oriented_interpreter_heading} contains
both kinds of translators.

    \end{center}
\end{figure}

The \emph{Contents of Communication} is described by the
\emph{Lasswell Formula} (figure \ref{lasswell_figure}). After it, communication
consists of the five elements: \emph{Sender} (Who) and \emph{Receiver} (Whom),
\emph{Message} (What), \emph{Language} (Channel) and \emph{Result} (Effect).
The first four of these will be considered in the specification of the
knowledge modelling language introduced in chapter
\ref{cybernetics_oriented_language_heading}. The effects a communication has
(fifth element) are not a prerequisite for that communication to happen and
thus not interesting in the context of its technical realisation, as
investigated later in this work.
