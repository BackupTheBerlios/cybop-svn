Extensible Programming for the 21st Century/ XML Based Programming \cite{wilson}:
- suggests to put an additional layer of abstraction (in XML) on top of current
programming languages
- programmers would be able to customise their "views" of software without
modifying the underlying model

"We believe that next-generation programming systems will store source code as XML,
rather than as flat text. Programmers will not see or edit XML tags; instead, their
editors will render these models to create human-friendly views, just as web browsers
render HTML. For example, a program might be stored on disk like this:"

<doc>Only replace below threshold</doc>
<cond>
  <test>
    <compare-expr operator="less">
      <field-expr field="age"><evaluate>record</evaluate></field-expr>
      <evaluate>threshold</evaluate>
    </compare-expr>
  </test>
  <body>
    <invoke-expr method="release"><evaluate>record</evaluate></invoke-expr>
  </body>
</cond>

- would be viewed and edited like this:

// Only replace below threshold
if (record.age < threshold) {
    record.release();
}

or:

if (record.age < threshold)    /* Only replace below threshold */
{
        record.release();
}

or even this (Scheme language):

;;; Only replace below threshold
(if (< (record 'age) threshold)
    (record 'release))
