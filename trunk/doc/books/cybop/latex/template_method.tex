\subsubsection{Template Method}
\label{template_method_heading}
\index{Template Method Pattern}
\index{Hook Method Pattern}

The \emph{Template Method} pattern \cite{gamma1995}, also called
\emph{Hook Method}, is an abstract definition of the \emph{Skeleton} of an
algorithm. The implementation of one or more steps of that algorithm is
delegated to a sub class (figure \ref{templatemethod_figure}).

The idea of algorithm (method) templates was taken over in the design of the
new language described in chapter \ref{cybernetics_oriented_language_heading}.
The single template parts, however, are not inherited but implemented in
\emph{part} templates referenced by their corresponding \emph{whole} template,
which is actually more similar to the previously described \emph{Whole-Part}
pattern (section \ref{design_heading}).
