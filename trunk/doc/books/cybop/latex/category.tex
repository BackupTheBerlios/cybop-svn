Offline thinking (in terms of second order) enables humans not only to
discriminate items but also to \emph{categorise} them into superior groups.
Since it is impossible to exactly model the real world in complete, compromises
have to be made: People do not model every single item in their minds but rather
group them into \emph{Types} (\emph{Classes}) of common characteristics.

This kind of classification stems from the earliest days of ancient science.
\emph{Plato}'s (429-347 B.C.) pupil \emph{Aristotle} (384-322 B.C.), being the
teacher of \emph{Alexander the Great}, was the first philosopher who logically
captured and organised the world. It was him who sorted items into clear groups
which he called \emph{Categories}. And it was him who first distinguished
between \emph{enlivened} and \emph{unenlivened} nature; who parted living forms
into \emph{Plants}, \emph{Animals} and \emph{Humans}. The science of biology
calls this classification a \emph{Systematics} (figure \ref{nature_figure}).

\emph{Categorisation} (classification) can be seen from two sides, depending on
what direction of that relationship one wants to emphasise. Taking Aristotle's
examples, \emph{Living Thing} would be a \emph{Generalisation} of \emph{Plants},
\emph{Animals} and \emph{Humans}. \emph{Animal} would be a \emph{Specialisation}
of \emph{Living Thing}.

Software developers often call categorisation an \emph{is-a} relationship and
talk of \emph{Super} and \emph{Sub} categories (sometimes also \emph{Parent}
and \emph{Child} categories). Section \ref{inheritance_heading} described how
\emph{Object Oriented Programming} (OOP) uses categorisation to let a sub class
inherit attributes and methods from its super class.
