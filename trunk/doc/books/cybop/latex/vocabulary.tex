The \emph{Vocabulary} is what fills a language with life. It delivers the
\emph{Terms} and \emph{Symbols} that are combined after the rules of a syntax.

XML allows to define and exchange the whole vocabulary of a language. It offers
two ways in which a list of legal elements can be defined: The traditional
\emph{Document Type Definition} (DTD) and the more modern
\emph{XML Schema Definition} (XSD). Besides the vocabulary, DTD and XSD define
the structure of an XML document and allow to typify, constrain and validate
items. In addition to DTD and XSD, the \emph{Extended Backus Naur Form} (EBNF)
of CYBOL is given following.

The language definitions were not added as appendix to this work, because
firstly, they are not too long and secondly, an understanding of the CYBOL
elements is necessary to be able to grasp the constructs and examples given in
later sections.

%Model and Metamodel \cite{sowa}, p. 431 and (for UML): p.436
%- UML needs a meta model describing its graphical model elements
%(Class, Association etc. are treated as classes themselves)
%- XML needs special definition languages (DTD, XSD)
%--> Show that CYBOL is its own meta model and can describe itself!
