Humans understand their environment by building simplified models (concepts) of
it. These are based on fundamental \emph{Abstractions} like \emph{Item},
\emph{Category} or \emph{Compound} (figure \ref{abstraction_figure}), which are
the topic of this section. Part of it was already published in \cite{heller2004}.
