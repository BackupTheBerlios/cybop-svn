Gilbert Carl Herschberger II writes \cite{josgeneral}: \textit{A computer is a
grossly oversimplified model of a human being. Humans can learn more about
themselves by working with this model. And, they might learn more about what
makes a good model by looking at themselves.} To the many analogies a computer
has with a human being belong its input/ output (i/o) devices (figure
\ref{computer_figure}), many of which have an equivalent organ in the human
body:

\begin{itemize}
    \item[-] \emph{Eye}: Camera, Scanner
    \item[-] \emph{Ear}: Microphone
    \item[-] \emph{Nose, Tongue}: Sensors
    \item[-] \emph{Skin}: Keyboard, Mouse, Joystick
    \item[-] \emph{Larynx}: Loudspeaker
    \item[-] \emph{Extremity}: Monitor, Printer, Braille Panel, Arm, Wheel
\end{itemize}

The difference to \emph{Robotics} is that a robot has additional devices.
Various \emph{Sensors} are used for information input; many moveable parts like
\emph{Arms} or \emph{Wheels} take motoric action and can be compared to the
extremities of the human body. Table \ref{environment_table} gives an
impression of how technical and biological environments can be compared.

To sum up: Among the abstract knowledge models stored in a system are some that
describe the structure and capabilities of the system itself.
