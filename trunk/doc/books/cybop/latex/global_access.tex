Statically accessible (manager) classes are often introduced to frameworks
(section \ref{framework_heading}) because some instances can not be reached
anymore along normal object associations. With instance models having a tree
structure being directed and acyclic, each object can be reached anytime in a
consistent way, by navigating down the tree branches. A pure instance tree in a
computer's \emph{Random Access Memory} (RAM) represents an unidirectional
structure that permits data access along \emph{well-defined} paths.

Global access via static types, on the other hand, allows \emph{any} instance
to address data in memory \emph{directly}, which not only complicates software
development and maintenance, but, due to uncontrollable access, is a potential
security risk. The usage of static objects accessible by any other part in a
system is an \emph{Anti Pattern} to \emph{Inversion of Control} (IoC) (section
\ref{inversion_of_control_heading}), highly insecure and hence undesirable.
Chapter \ref{knowledge_schema_heading} does therefore classify all patterns
using global (static) access as not recommendable. And the language and
interpreter introduced in chapters \ref{cybernetics_oriented_language_heading}
and \ref{cybernetics_oriented_interpreter_heading} do avoid their usage.
