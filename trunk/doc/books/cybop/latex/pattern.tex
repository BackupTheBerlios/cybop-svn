The previous sections investigated basic concepts offered by today's
programming languages and -paradigms. The following and all later sections of
this chapter describe design techniques that belong to a higher conceptual
level. \emph{Patterns}, in a more correct form called \emph{Software Patterns},
are the first technique dealt with. They became popular through
\emph{Object Oriented Programming} (OOP), but their use is not limited to OOP
languages. Patterns represent solutions for recurring software design problems
and can be understood as recommendations for how to build software in an
elegant and efficient way. In the past, more detailed definitions have been
given by meanwhile well-known authors.

Christopher Alexander, an architect and urban planner, writes \cite{alexander}:
\textit{Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in
our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem,
in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever
doing it the same way twice.} He gave this definition primarily for problems
occuring in architecture, construction, and urban/regional planning, but it can
be applied in the same manner to software design, as done first by Ward
Cunningham and others \cite{portland}.

The systems designer Swift \cite{designmatrix} sees a pattern as:
\textit{essentially a morphological law, a relationship among parts (pattern
components) within a particular context. Specifically, a pattern expresses a
relationship among parts that resolves problems that would exist if the
relationship were missing. As patterns express these relationships, they are
not formulae or algorithms, but rather loose rules of thumb or heuristics.}

The \emph{Gang of Four} (GoF) (Erich Gamma et al.) applied Alexander's
definition to object oriented software and created a whole catalogue of design
patterns \cite{gamma1995}. After them, patterns are: \textit{Structured models
of thinking that represent reusable solutions for one-and-the-same design
problem. They shall support the development, maintenance and extension of large
software systems, while being independent from concrete implementation
languages.} The experts identified four basic elements of each pattern:
\emph{Name}, \emph{Problem}, \emph{Solution} and \emph{Consequences}
(advantages and disadvantages).

For Frank Buschmann et al., software patterns contain the knowledge of
experienced software engineers and help to improve the quality of decision
making \cite{buschmann}. In his opinion, they are basic solutions for problems
that already occurred in a similar way before. Therefore, the author talks of
\emph{Problem Solution Pairs}.

Martin Fowler means that: \textit{A pattern is some idea that already was
helpful in a practical context and will probably be useful in other contexts,
too.} \cite{fowler1997}. After him, patterns, however they are written, have
four essential parts: \emph{Context}, \emph{Problem}, \emph{Forces} and
\emph{Solution}.

Depending on their experience, software developers can produce good or bad
solutions, in every domain. One possibility to improve less well-done designs or
to extend legacy systems are the so-called \emph{Anti-Patterns} (telling how to go
from a problem to a bad solution), or the contrasting \emph{Amelioration Patterns}
(telling how to go from a bad solution to a good solution) \cite{portland}.
Both help finding patterns in wrong-designed systems and give advice for their
improvement.

There are efforts to combine patterns to form a \emph{Pattern Language}, also
called \emph{Pattern System} \cite{buschmann}. Such systems describe
dependencies between patterns, specify rules for pattern combination and show
how patterns can be implemented and used in software development practice.

\end{figure}

Several schemes of \emph{Pattern Classification} exist. One possible is shown in
figure \ref{pattern_figure}. Considering the level of abstraction (granularity),
it distinguishes between \emph{Architectural-}, \emph{Design-} and \emph{Idiomatic}
patterns \cite{buschmann}. Design patterns, in turn, are divided after their
functionality (problem category) into \emph{Creational-}, \emph{Structural-}
and \emph{Behavioural} patterns \cite{gamma1995}. The Wikipedia Encyclopedia
\cite{wikipedia} mentions three further problem categories: \emph{Fundamental-},
\emph{Concurrency-} and \emph{Real-time} patterns. Other criteria (dimensions) of
classification exist. Fowler introduces a completely different category which he
calls \emph{Analysis Patterns} \cite{fowler1997}. These are applicable early in the
software engineering process (chapter \ref{software_engineering_process_heading}).
And he defines patterns that are more often used for describing the modelling
\emph{Language} than the actual \emph{Models} as \emph{Meta Model Patterns}.

In the following sections, a greater number of known patterns will be described
briefly. They form the scientific basis for the ideas following in part
\ref{contribution_heading} of this work and some of them appear in a modified
form in the language and interpreter introduced in part \ref{proof_heading}.
Chapter \ref{knowledge_schema_heading} moreover introduces a new pattern
systematics for which it references common patterns as introduced here.
However, since the next sections do not want to copy the work accomplished by
the above-mentioned authors, they refer to the corresponding literaric source
for more detailed explanation.
