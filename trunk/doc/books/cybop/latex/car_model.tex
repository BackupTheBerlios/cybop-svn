A \emph{Computer Aided Design} (CAD)/ \emph{Computer Aided Manufacturing} (CAM)
system of a car manufacturer will have a \emph{Car} model like the one shown in
table \ref{car_table}.

\begin{table}[ht]
    \begin{center}
        \begin{footnotesize}
        \begin{tabular}{| p{105mm} |}
            \hline
            \textbf{Model Category}\\
            \hline
            Car\\
            \hline
            Body, Chassis, Engine, Transmission\\
            \hline
            Door, Axle, Wheel, Cylinder\\
            \hline
            Window, Suspension, Plunger\\
            \hline
        \end{tabular}
        \end{footnotesize}
        \caption{Car Model}
        \label{car_table}
    \end{center}
\end{table}

The ontology contains multiple categories of models which are composed of each
other. An \emph{Engine} consists of a \emph{Cylinder} which consists of a
\emph{Plunger} and so on. That is why people speak of different \emph{Layers}
or \emph{Levels} of abstract models. An \emph{Axle} belongs to one level and a
\emph{Chassis} belongs to another, higher level. In a good ontology, the
relations between models are always \emph{unidirectional}, that is a chassis
can link to axles but not the other way.
