\index{Layer Supertype Pattern}

The \emph{Layer Supertype} pattern \cite{fowler2002} is a rather simple but
quite useful one. It assumes that a system is structured using the
\emph{Layers} pattern. What the pattern proposes is to add a (possibly
abstract) class that all other classes in its layer inherit from (figure
\ref{supertype_figure}). The reason is that basic functionality common to all
classes in a layer, for example persistence- or logging capabilities, can be
provided once by the supertype, such avoiding redundancies.

        \label{supertype_figure}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

The language introduced in chapter \ref{cybernetics_oriented_language_heading}
does not use inheritance and thus cannot use super knowledge templates in the
meaning of the \emph{Layer Supertype} pattern. Nevertheless, the pattern is important
because of its idea to categorise similar knowledge, such as all templates of:
a \emph{Textual User Interface} (TUI), a \emph{Graphical User Interface} (GUI),
a \emph{Domain Model} etc.
