In his very clear book, Tanenbaum \cite{tanenbaum1999} organises instructions
in abstract \emph{Levels} (figure \ref{vm_figure}), which he also calls
\emph{Virtual Machines} (VM), since each level could be seen as hypothetic
computer with an own language. Further on, he considers hardware and software
to be \textit{logically equivalent} because one could replace the other.

        \label{vm_figure}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

The next sub sections are based on this structure. They describe lower levels,
close to hardware. Later sections then place more emphasis on concepts
introduced by higher-level \emph{Problem Oriented Languages} (POL).
