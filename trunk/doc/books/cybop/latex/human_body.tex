Figure \ref{human_figure} shows parts of the animalic nerve system of a human
being. \emph{Sensoric} organs are used for information input; \emph{motoric}
organs for information output.

The five (seven) human senses were already shown in table \ref{senses_table}.
They are able to receive signals which are transported by different mediums.
The transport mechanisms rely on various physical and chemical \emph{Effects},
as shown in table \ref{effects_table}. Each sense is represented by an
\emph{Organ}. The optic cells of the retina of an \emph{Eye} bundle light
stimuli which the optic nerve forwards as electrical signal to the brain. The
inner \emph{Ear} transforms oscillation frequencies of sound-waves into
electrical signals to send on to the brain. And so forth.

While the \emph{Reception} of information is based on \emph{Nerve Cells}, it is
\emph{Muscle Cells} which are responsible for information \emph{Sending}.
Humans communicate for example through visual \emph{Gestures} using their
\emph{Extremities} or through acoustical \emph{Talking} using their
\emph{Larynx}/ \emph{Vocal Chords}. The latter, too, is based on muscle
activity.
