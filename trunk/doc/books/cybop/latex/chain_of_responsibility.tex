The \emph{Chain of Responsibility} pattern \cite{gamma1995} is similar to the
\emph{Composite}, in that it represents a recursive structure as well. Objects
destined to solve a task are linked with a corresponding \emph{Successor}
(figure \ref{chain_figure}), such forming a chain. If an object is not able to
solve a task, that task is forwarded to the object's successor, along the chain.

The pattern found wide application, for example in help systems, in event
handling frameworks or for exception handling. Its \emph{Handler} class is
known under synonyms like \emph{Event Handler}, \emph{Bureaucrat} or
\emph{Responder}. Frequently, the pattern gets misused by delegating messages
not only to children but also to the parent of objects. The
\emph{Hierarhical Model View Controller} (HMVC) pattern (section
\ref{hierarchical_model_view_controller_heading}) is one example for this. It
causes unfavourable bidirectional dependencies and leads to stronger coupling
between the layers of a framework, because parent- and child objects then
reference each other.

Much like state knowledge (data structures) is representable by the knowledge
schema being described in chapter \ref{knowledge_schema_heading}, also logic
knowledge (algorithms, operations) is. A compound logic model may contain
further logic models, which it calls or sends as signal in a manner similar to
the \emph{Chain of Responsibility} principle.
