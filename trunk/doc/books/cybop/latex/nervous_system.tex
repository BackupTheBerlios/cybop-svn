\subsection{Nervous System}
\label{nervous_system_heading}

The brain's higher cognitive and emotional functions (conscious experience as
well as unconscious processes) are directed by the \emph{Cerebrum}, also called
\emph{Cerebral Cortex} (section \ref{brain_regions_heading}). Its two almost
symmetrical halves, called the \emph{Cerebral Hemispheres}, contain four
\emph{Lobes}, each \cite{discoveringpsychology}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item[-] \emph{Frontal Lobe:} assists in motor control and cognitive
        activities, such as planning, making decisions, setting goals, and
        relating the present to the future through purposeful behavior
    \item[-] \emph{Parietal Lobe:} assists in sensory processes, spatial
        interpretation, attention, and language comprehension
    \item[-] \emph{Occipital Lobe:} processes visual information and passes its
        conclusions to the parietal and temporal lobes
    \item[-] \emph{Temporal Lobe:} assists in auditory perception, language
        comprehension, and visual recognition
\end{itemize}
