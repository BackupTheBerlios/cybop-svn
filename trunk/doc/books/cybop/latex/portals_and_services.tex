As OSS became popular over the years, the number of its supporters rose. It is
not long time that \emph{Sourceforge} \cite{sourceforge}, the first
\emph{Development Portal} for FLOSS, was opened. Shortly after, others like
\emph{Freshmeat} \cite{freshmeat} followed and meanwhile, there are also
national initiatives like \emph{BerliOS} \cite{berlios} in Germany. Also the
\emph{Free Software Foundation} (FSF) offers an own portal called
\emph{Savannah} \cite{savannah}, hosting exclusively \emph{free} \cite{gnu}
software projects. Figure \ref{portals_figure} shows the four portals by their
name, logo and \emph{Uniform Resource Locator} (URL).

As \emph{BerliOS} states in its slogan, it is the aim of development portals of
that kind to \textit{foster open source development}. In \emph{Savannah's}
words, they are \textit{central points for the development, distribution and
maintenance of FLOSS}. Although very often supported by well-known sponsors,
most portals are and want to stay independent. Using them, OSS projects and their
developers are offered several free services (figure \ref{services_figure}).
Since not all of these are always useful, projects can configure their portal
sites as needed.

\emph{Res Medicinae} was one of the first OSS projects registered at
Sourceforge (number 4237 of now more than 100,000). CYBOP (CYBOL, CYBOI) is
hosted at BerliOS.
