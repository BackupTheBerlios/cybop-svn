cybol.tex
add code example; can CYBOL possibly replace LaTeX?
\documentclass[a4paper,twoside,12pt]{thesis}
a TeX tag is similar to a CYBOL part
meta properties are given in []
the model value is given in {}

model and compare:
- doc/cybol/cybol.xml --> impossible, because DTD has to be used to define the structure!? (see cybol.dtd)
- doc/cybol/xml.cybol
- doc/cybol/cybol.cybol
in the same manner as presentation_and_content.tex

cybol: compare "knowledge" and "encapsulated_knowledge" access with
"direct" (a constant pointing to a memory area) and
"indirect" (via register) memory access in CPU

cyboi: add Petri Net diagram

resmedicinae: add diagram showing episode-based EHR over time

Add to Component Oriented Programming (COP) Apache-Jakarta-Avalon Chapter:
When I announced the first edition of the CYBOP book on the Apache Excalibur
Developers mailing list \ref{<dev@excalibur.apache.org>}, Leo Simons <mail@leosimons.com>
and Peter Royal <proyal@apache.org> informed me that there was an ancestor of Avalon:
\emph{DNA's Not Avalon} (DNA), what they also used to call \emph{Avalon5}
\ref{http://dna.codehaus.org/}. The project seems to have been active between
2003 and 2004 and remained silent since.
