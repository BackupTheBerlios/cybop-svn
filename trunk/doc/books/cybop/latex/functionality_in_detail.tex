\index{CYBOI Control Flow}

CYBOI's architecture is based on three main parts, as introduced by figure
\ref{architecture_figure} before: \emph{Controller}, \emph{Applicator} and
\emph{Memoriser}. (The \emph{Globals} package is neglectable for the following
explanations, since it contains static constants and variables that are
\emph{omnipresent}.) They appear again in figure \ref{dependencies_figure}
which shows the \emph{Dependencies} between them. Additionally, the
\emph{Controller} modules and their \emph{Control Flow} is illustrated.
Starting from the \emph{cyboi} module, the following subsections will
demonstrate how CYBOI functions internally, along the flow of control touching
the modules: \emph{manager}, \emph{checker} and \emph{handler}. After that, the
execution of operations in the \emph{Applicator} as well as the creation and
transition of data in the \emph{Memoriser} are described.
