Lastly, there are some ideas which may seem a bit crazy or too fictionary for
serious scientific work, which is why they were put into this extra section.

%A real philosophical problem is if knowledge models could be constructed with
%intrinsic properties only? Not top-down, but rather bottom-up!
%Unsolved question for the author of this work.
% Is there a possibility of building abstract models bottom-up, the top-most
% level being the final abstraction?

%The Basic Nature of States
%
%- light is only one kind of transported energy
%- others may exist
%- speed of light should be called the "cosmic" or "universal" speed
%
%- speed of light == basic speed in universe == absolute
%(other speeds can be added)
%- this basic speed exists everywhere, everything is moving (oscillating) in this speed
%- basic speed == comparable to "Takt" [German] frequency in a computer
%- when two bodies (human being in a railway train) are moving, their speeds can be added;
%they are only "riding" on the basic (absolute) speed of light which exists universally
%
%- waves have maxima and minima == two binary states 0 and 1
%- particles do not exist; they are built from states (of oscillations/waves)
