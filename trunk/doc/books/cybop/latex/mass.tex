A \emph{Solar System}, as concept, has very much in common with the atom. It
has a star, the \emph{Sun}, as its core and it has \emph{Planets} orbiting
around that star. Besides the conceptual interaction over space that also
exists here, there is another relation worth paying attention to: \emph{Mass}.
It has great influence on the \emph{Gravitational Force}.

Conceptually, the solar system can be treated as a closed field of \emph{Mass},
the sun representing the centre, the planets additions. The solar system as a
\emph{Whole} knows about the masses of its \emph{Parts}, what can be considered
a conceptual interaction.

Another example, taken from informatics, are \emph{Artificial Neural Networks}
(ANN) consisting of \emph{Neurons} and \emph{weighted} connections between them.
%(section \ref{artificial_neural_network_heading}).
Ideally, the ANN knows
about its neurons -- or, depending on its design, the layers that contain them
-- and the corresponding connections. This structural information needs to be
complemented by \emph{Weight} (\emph{Mass}) information indicating the strength
(importance) of an association between neurons.
