\subsection{Interaction}
\label{interaction_heading}
\index{Interaction}

As was explained before, most abstract models of the human mind have a composed
nature, that is consist of smaller parts. If being compounds, they hold certain
information about their parts, namely their name, model and abstraction. More
on this in section \ref{knowledge_representation_heading}. But isn't there
other detailed knowledge a compound must have about its parts? What about the
order or position, the size or colour of parts within their compound?
