\subsection{Knowledge Ontology}

The previous sections tried to demonstrate the importance of \emph{Composition}
for knowledge modelling. One technique that was mentioned in this context are
\emph{Ontologies}. Section \ref{conceptual_network_heading} introduced some of
its numerous definitions. Section \ref{association_elimination_heading}
demonstrated how the principle of \emph{Hierarchy} may be applied to obtain an
\emph{Ontology}. The layers forming an ontology were called
\emph{Ontological Level}.

Basically, an ontology represents a systematic description of complex domain
contexts. This work uses its own adapted definition, and considers an ontology
to be \emph{a strict hierarchy of abstract models, organised in levels of
growing granularity, that are solely unidirectionally related}.

Terminologies as described in section \ref{terminology_heading} may be used to
specify the basic elements of an ontology. Every term may be represented by an
own abstract model (concept) containing a number of strings, one for each
terminology system. Further strings may stand for language translations, which
has importance for \emph{Internationalisation}.

The following examples may seem simple, but want to strengthen the hierarchical
thinking of the reader, under consideration of the granularity of models.
