\subsection{Standards Development}
\label{standards_development_heading}
\index{Standards Development Criticism}

Standards development in its today's form found a lot of critics, especially
among developers of the OSS community \cite{openehrtechnical}. Their complaints
concern the:

\begin{itemize}
    \item[-] Nondisclosure and secrecy of specifications
    \item[-] Lengthy update cycles
    \item[-] Limited access to standardisation bodies
    \item[-] High membership fees
\end{itemize}

Thomas Beale who argues that the current paradigm of development of technical/
information standards were broken at the core anyway \cite{openehrtechnical},
has some more arguments, which are summarised following.

\input{static_documents}
