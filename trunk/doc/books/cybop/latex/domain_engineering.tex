Undoubtedly, \emph{Object Oriented Programming} (OOP) (section
\ref{object_oriented_programming_heading}) is one of the most popular programming
paradigms in use today. Its application within a \emph{Software Engineering Process}
(SEP) (chapter \ref{software_engineering_process_heading}) requires two preliminary
phases called \emph{Object Oriented Analysis} (OOA) and \emph{Object Oriented Design}
(OOD).

\begin{figure}[ht]

        \label{sixpack_figure}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

The area of \emph{System Family Engineering} applies a so-called \emph{Six-Pack}
approach (figure \ref{sixpack_figure}) which is based on the separation of
\emph{Domain Engineering} (DE) and \emph{Application Engineering} (AE).
\textit{The focus of AE is a single system whereas the focus of DE is on
multiple related systems within a domain}, as \cite{domainengg} defines. Both of
them consist of analysis-, design- and implementation phases. The results of
each DE phase are \emph{fed in} as foundation for the work to be done in AE.
Most of the topics described in the previous sections
(\ref{paradigm_and_language_heading}, \ref{pattern_heading} and
\ref{component_oriented_programming_heading}) turned around techniques which
are applicable to both, DE as well as AE.

In Krzysztof Czarnecki's opinion \cite{czarnecki}, the only SEPs adequately
addressing the issue of \emph{Development for Reuse} were DE methodologies,
most of which had essentially the same structure. He writes:

\begin{quote}
    \emph{Domain Engineering} is the activity of \emph{collecting},
    \emph{organizing}, and \emph{storing} past experience in building systems or
    parts of systems in a particular domain in the form of reusable assets (i.e.
    reusable work-products), as well as providing an adequate means for
    \emph{reusing} these assets (i.e. retrieval, qualification, dissemination,
    adaptation, assembly, etc.) when building new systems.
\end{quote}

After him, the main difference between traditional OOA/ OOD- and DE methods
were that the former focus on developing \emph{Single} systems, the latter
though on developing \emph{Families} of systems. Combined with the definition
stated above (\cite{domainengg}), this means that OOA/ OOD methods may be used
for application-, but not domain engineering. Different methods and techniques
exist for DE. Many are given in \cite{wartik, arrango, fere}. Just a few of
them shall be mentioned here:

\begin{itemize}
    \item{\emph{Feature Oriented Domain Analysis} (FODA)}
    \item{\emph{Reuse driven Software Engineering Business} (RSEB)}
    \item{\emph{Feature RSEB} (FeatuRSEB)}
\end{itemize}

The RSEB methodology \cite{jacobson1997} places emphasis on purely
\emph{Object Oriented} (OO) techniques which it uses together with the
\emph{Unified Modelling Language} (UML). \emph{Features} and \emph{Feature Models}
(section \ref{feature_model_heading}), as concept, were introduced by the FODA
\cite{foda}. The combination of RSEB and FODA results in the FeatuRSEB approach
\cite{griss}. It permits a separate treatment of domain knowledge and system
functionality.

However, this work is less interested in the details of DE software development
\emph{Methods}, but rather in their \emph{Knowledge Abstraction-} and
\emph{Implementation} techniques. Some of them are investigated in the
following sections.
