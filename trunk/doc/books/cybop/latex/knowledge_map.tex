\label{knowledge_map_heading}

A \emph{Topic Map} is ... a standard paradigm for the interchange of knowledge structures.

A \emph{Concept Map} is a diagram meant to represent ideas, each idea being
represented by a shape (rectangle, ellipse, image, ...). The diagram becomes
a concept map when relations link these ideas and \emph{Hypertext Links} are
added to these ideas which allows navigation to either a detailed description,
for example a web page providing details on this idea, or another concept map.

A \emph{Mind Map} is a powerful graphic technique which provides a universal
key to unlock the potential of the brain. It harnesses the full range of cortical
skills -- word, image, number, logic, rhythm, colour and spatial awareness --
in a single, uniquely powerful manner. In so doing, it gives you the freedom
to roam the infinite expanses of your brain. The Mind Map can be applied to
every aspect of life where improved learning and clearer thinking will enhance
human performance.

A \emph{Mind Map} is a picture that represents semantic connections between
portions of learned material.
