The creation of transient knowledge models (to be kept in memory, at runtime)
from persistent knowledge templates (given in form of CYBOL sources) is not a
trivial thing. It is a mechanism consisting of a cascade of model transitions,
comparable to the \emph{Information Processing Model} of cognitive psychology
(section \ref{information_processing_model_heading}). One may imagine this as a
state changing its appearance, while \emph{wandering} through the system. The
same mechanism is applied when handling communication data (figure
\ref{transition_figure}). Because CYBOI's architecture is easily extensible
with various modules, such as \emph{import/ export} (i/e) filters for different
kinds of communication, it may act as universal data converter. All
corresponding modules belong to the \emph{Memoriser} part of CYBOI.

As opposed to the knowledge acquirement in \emph{Artificial Neural Networks}
(ANN),
%(section \ref{artificial_neural_network_heading}),
the knowledge in CYBOP
systems is not learned, but \emph{injected} by reading from external knowledge
sources, which can be manipulated in a flexible manner any time. The difference
to standard applications is that these hard-wire their knowledge within the
system.

A data input (i/p), after having been processed by a \emph{receive} procedure
(\emph{communicator} modules), results in a stream -- a data array in memory. A
\emph{parse} procedure (\emph{converter} modules), depending on the kind of
abstraction of the data, then builds a structure out of this simple array. The
structure, finally, passes a \emph{decode} procedure (\emph{translator}
modules) which creates a knowledge model.

Whenever an application running within CYBOI wants to send data, may it be to
another system or for making them persistent on a local \emph{Hard Disk Drive}
(HDD), translator, converter and communicator have to be crossed in the
opposite direction. Because a running application system is a tree of knowledge
models allocating space in memory, parts of that tree can be \emph{serialised}
easily. It has to be mentioned, though, that slight changes of the XML format
are necessary to achieve this: The usual quotation marks used to delimit XML
attribute values have to be replaced with differing \emph{begin} and \emph{end}
characters. This feature is an open issue which the current version of CYBOI
does not provide yet.
