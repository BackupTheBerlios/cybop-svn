In CYBOP, all knowledge, that is states as well as logic, belongs to the
\emph{Statics} of a system. It is described by fixed structures. The processing
of knowledge at runtime, in order to control a system, is called \emph{Dynamics}.

The complete modelling and storage of static knowledge requires a formal
language, which gets introduced as \emph{Cybernetics Oriented Language} (CYBOL)
in this work. Its dynamic processing, close to hardware, is guaranteed by the
\emph{Cybernetics Oriented Interpreter} (CYBOI) which is needed to run systems
defined in CYBOL (figure \ref{cybop_approach_figure}).

Chapters \ref{cybernetics_oriented_language_heading} and
\ref{cybernetics_oriented_interpreter_heading} explain CYBOL and CYBOI,
respectively. Both are used in the \emph{Res Medicinae} prototype application
which gets introduced in chapter \ref{res_medicinae_heading}. Altogether,
CYBOL, CYBOI and the theoretical concepts behind are called
\emph{Cybernetics Oriented Programming} (CYBOP).
