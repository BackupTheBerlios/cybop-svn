The \emph{Generalised Architecture for Languages, Encyclopaedias and
Nomenclatures in Medicine} (GALEN) is trying to construct a:
\textit{semantically sound model of clinical terminology} -- the GALEN
\emph{Common Reference Model} (CRM). The formal rules (representation scheme)
for manipulating its concepts are provided by the \emph{GALEN Representation
and Integration Language} (GRAIL).

The original GALEN project was sponsored by the \emph{European Union} (EU) and
open-sourced and renamed into \emph{OpenGALEN}, in 1999. It later continued as
part of the \emph{Synergy on the Extranet} (SynEx) project \cite{synex}, which
arose from the \emph{Synapses} project aiming at implementing a federated
healthcare record server.
