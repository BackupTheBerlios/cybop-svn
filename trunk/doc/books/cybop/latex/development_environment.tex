\subsection{Development Environment}
\label{development_environment_heading}
\index{CYBOI Development Environment}

Current CYBOI development happens under the \emph{Linux} OS, using the
\emph{C Compiler} of the \emph{GNUï¿½Compiler Collection} (gcc) \cite{gcc}.
CYBOI's code base has been kept simple and following the \emph{C Standard}
\cite{ansic} of the \emph{American National Standards Institute} (ANSI), which
is why it should be compilable on other platforms, too. Exceptions to be
considered are the above-mentioned, platform-dependent libraries with
differences between UNIX or derivates, Windows-, and other OS. As temporary
workaround, the \emph{CYGWIN} runtime environment \cite{cygwin} is used for
running CYBOI under Windows.

The most important development tool is a simple text editor; it is used for
writing program code. Compilation is started on a console or shell. Likewise,
the compiled binary is run there, for testing purposes and error debugging.
