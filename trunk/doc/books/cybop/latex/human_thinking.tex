\section{Human Thinking}
\label{human_thinking_heading}
\index{Human Thinking}

Knowledge as created by the human mind is learned by associating information,
by embedding it in a \emph{Context}, as investigated by \emph{Pragmatics}, a
subfield of linguistics \cite{wikipedia}. It is thus built of structured,
inter-related data (definitions given in section
\ref{knowledge_engineering_heading}). The interesting question explored in this
section is what kind of structures and relations are used in knowledge models
as known from nature, that is \emph{Human Thinking}?
