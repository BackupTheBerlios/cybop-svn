To pursue the idea of a purely hierarchical software system, it seems useful to
investigate in which way domain data models can get simplified. This section
therefore demonstrates how the principle of \emph{Hierarchy} may be applied to
obtain an \emph{Ontology} \cite{hellerkunze}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[scale=0.3,angle=-90]{graphic/elimination.pdf}
        \caption{Association Elimination in an EHR}
        \label{elimination_figure}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

An \emph{Electronic Health Record} (EHR) will serve as example domain model,
whose simplified structure is shown in figure \ref{elimination_figure}. It
consists of numerous parts whereof two may be \emph{Address} and \emph{Problem}.
Following the \emph{Episode-based EHR} recommendation \cite{westerhof},
\emph{Problem} may, besides others, consist of parts of type \emph{Subjective}
and \emph{Objective}. All these associations between part models are needed to
navigate through the overall domain model.

A frequent design decision in classical \emph{Object Oriented Programming}
(OOP) is to sum up common properties of \emph{Sub} models by introducing a
\emph{Super} model (category). It should never be \emph{Properties}, but rather
the \emph{Granularity} of objects leading to the creation of a super category,
as the later section \ref{categorisation_versus_composition_heading} will
recommend. The \emph{OpenEHR} project \cite{openehr} suggests to let the
above-mentioned sub models inherit from the more coarse-grained super
categories \emph{Record}, \emph{Unit} and \emph{Heading}.

Whichever reason -- once the super categories are there, they should be
associated similarly to their sub categories, that is in the same direction,
using solely \emph{unidirectional} dependencies. (The problematic nature of
bidirectional dependencies was elaborated in section \ref{pattern_heading}.)
Afterwards, all associations between sub categories become superfluous as every
sub category can reach its sibling across the super categories' association
(figure \ref{elimination_figure}). In other words:
\emph{Super- eliminate Sub Associations}.

Here a short Java code example for how the \emph{HealthRecord} may retrieve a
reference to \emph{Address}:

\begin{scriptsize}
    \begin{verbatim}
    Address a = (Address) get_element("address");
    \end{verbatim}
\end{scriptsize}

\emph{HealthRecord} inherits the \emph{get\_element} method from its super
category \emph{Record}. \emph{Record} holds differing sub models of category
\emph{Unit} and other instances. The \emph{get\_element} method delivers back
a general \emph{Model} that still needs to be down-casted to the expected sub
category \emph{Address}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[scale=0.3,angle=-90]{graphic/levels.pdf}
        \caption{Model Container and Ontological Levels}
        \label{levels_figure}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

The definition of models, their dependencies (defined by associations) and
granularities (defined by inheritance) in a software system results in several
\emph{Layers} of models of common granularity (figure \ref{levels_figure}).
These layers are often called \emph{Ontological Level} as they, together, form
an \emph{Ontology} (sections \ref{ontology_heading},
\ref{knowledge_ontology_heading}).

An ontology of that kind can, of course, be created for every knowledge model.
The financial sector -- like an insurance company, for example -- may use an
\emph{Insurance Record} with comparable structure.

The idea to structure software as a system of \emph{Layers} was also suggested
by the equally named pattern in section \ref{layers_heading}. The difference
between the two is that the \emph{Layers} pattern divides a system only by its
\emph{Functionality}, for example into \emph{User Interface}, \emph{Domain},
\emph{Data Mapper} and \emph{Data Source}. An \emph{Ontology} additionally
groups model items by their \emph{Granularity}. By inheriting from a common
superior category, sub categories indicate that they logically belong to the
same \emph{Layer}.

Continuing the structuring process of introducing more and more common super
categories, for all equally-granular items, the development culminates in one
top-most super category of all other categories in the system, which this paper
calls \emph{Model}. It is as general as the \emph{java.lang.Object} class for
the Java class library \cite{java}, only that it additionally represents a
\emph{Container} that can store models of any category, as explained in
\cite{hellerbohl}. In other words, \emph{Model} provides the meta functionality
of a container behaviour to \emph{all} other categories in a system.
