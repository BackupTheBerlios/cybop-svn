A \emph{Specification Language}, after \cite{wikipedia}, were a formal language
used during system analysis and design, as opposed to a \emph{Programming Language},
which were a mostly directly executable formal language used to implement a system.
As its name already indicates, a specification language describes systems at a much
higher abstract level than a programming language does. But that also means that it:
\textit{must be subject to a process of refinement (the filling-in of implementation
detail), before it can actually be implemented}, as \cite{wikipedia} writes.

Many kinds of specification languages exist. Being a de facto standard, only
the first two of those representatives listed following are introduced in
slightly more detail below:

\begin{itemize}
    \item[-] \emph{Unified Modeling Language} (UML) \cite{uml}
    \item[-] \emph{Feature Model} \cite{foda}
    \item[-] \emph{Z Specification Language} \cite{zspeclang} and
        \emph{B Specification Language} \cite{zb2005}
    \item[-] \emph{Vienna Development Method - Specification Language} (VDM-SL) \cite{vdmsl}
    \item[-] \emph{Specification and Description Language} (SDL) \cite{sdl}
    \item[-] \emph{Extended Meta Language} (Extended ML) \cite{extendedml}
\end{itemize}
