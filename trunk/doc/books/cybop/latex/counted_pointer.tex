The \emph{Counted Pointer} pattern \cite{buschmann} supports memory management
in the \emph{C++} programming language, by counting references to dynamically
created objects (figure \ref{pointer_figure}). That way, it can avoid the
destruction of an object through one client, while still being referenced by
other clients. Also, it helps avoiding memory leaks by cleaning up forgotten
objects in the style of a \emph{Garbage Collector}.

Since all of its knowledge is kept in just one huge tree structure, the
interpreter introduced in chapter \ref{cybernetics_oriented_interpreter_heading}
has memory management and reference counting capabilities built in by default.
