\index{CYBOI Process Launching}
\index{CYBOI main Procedure}

As every other C-, C++- or Java program, CYBOI has a \emph{main} procedure
(\emph{cyboi} module) serving as entry point for its process to run. It
triggers the system lifecycle (in the meaning of startup and shutdown of a
system process). After having initialised global variables and having read the
command line parameter, the rest of the system is started up by the
\emph{manage} procedure (\emph{manager} module).
