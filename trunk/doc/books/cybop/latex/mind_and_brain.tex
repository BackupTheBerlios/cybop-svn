\index{Software as Passive Knowledge and Active Control}

A first observation, when looking at human beings from a philosophical
perspective, is the separation of \emph{Mind} and \emph{Brain} (Body) (figure
\ref{staticsdynamics_figure}). Accordingly, CYBOP treats computers as
\emph{Systems} owning and processing \emph{Knowledge}. This is not unlike the
idea of \emph{Agent} systems owning a \emph{Knowledge Base} (section
\ref{agent_oriented_programming_heading}). All abstract knowledge that humans
make up belongs to their mind. The brain is merely a physical carrier of
knowledge.

        \label{staticsdynamics_figure}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

Another conclusion resulting from this first observation is that there should
actually be two kinds of software: one representing \emph{passive} knowledge
and the other \emph{actively} controlling a system, close to hardware.

Chapter \ref{statics_and_dynamics_heading} deals with this topic.
