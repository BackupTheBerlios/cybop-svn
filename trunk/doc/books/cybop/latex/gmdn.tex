\emph{Global Medical Device Nomenclature} (GMDN) is a: \textit{collection of
internationally recognised terms used to accurately describe and catalogue
medical devices \ldots\ in particular, the products used in the diagnosis,
prevention, monitoring, treatment or alleviation of disease or injury in
humans.} It is divided into 12 categories of devices and contains nearly 7,000
terms plus more than 10,000 synonyms to make the GMDN easier to use.
