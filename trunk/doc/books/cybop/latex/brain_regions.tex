\subsection{Brain Regions}

\index{PNS}

\emph{Neurology} as branch of \emph{Medicine} deals with the
\emph{Central Nervous System} (CNS) and \emph{Peripheral Nervous System} (PNS)
of human beings. These can be further divided as shown in figure
\ref{nervoussystem_figure}.

\begin{figure}[ht]

        \includegraphics[scale=0.3,angle=-90]{graphic/nervoussystem.pdf}
        \caption{Divisions of the Nervous System \cite{adventuresinneuroanatomy}}
        \label{nervoussystem_figure}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

Not all parts of this systematics shall be explained here; more details can be
found at \cite{pschyrembel}. Chapter \ref{state_and_logic_heading} will make
some remarks on the PNS, whose \emph{Neurons} (nerve cells) can be functionally
divided into \emph{sensory} (\emph{afferent}) and \emph{motor}
(\emph{efferent}) ones. The functions of some brain structures, as part of the
CNS, are described in table \ref{brainstructures_table}. At the same time, this
table (where \emph{n/a} means \emph{not applicable}) tries to give possible
analogies to a standard computer system, whereby hardware as well as software
are considered.

\begin{table}[ht]

            Midbrain %(superior/ inferior colliculi, red nucleus)
            & Vision, Audition, Eye- and Body Movement
            & I/O Device Drivers, Translation\\
            \hline
        \end{tabular}

\end{table}

Of course, the analogies do not match exactly. Also, there are many functions
-- like \emph{Thought} or \emph{Emotions} -- that a computer cannot perform.
The important thing to notice, however, is that there are brain regions mainly
\emph{storing} (Hippocampus) and \emph{applying} knowledge (Cerebral Cortex) and
others \emph{coordinating} the input/ output (i/o) of that knowledge (Midbrain,
Basal Ganglia) in form of simplified information, through sensoric/ motoric
organs of the human body.

That is, what philosophy calls \emph{Mind} (section \ref{mind_and_body_heading})
is the \emph{Knowledge} that is anatomically-physically mainly situated in the
\emph{Hippocampus} and \emph{Cerebral Cortex}. And again, i/o control does not
only rely on hardware devices but also on the corresponding driver software and
signalling mechanism. To say it differently: The software that contains
application/ domain knowledge is to be treated \emph{separately} from system
control software.
