The \emph{Command} pattern \cite{gamma1995}, also known as \emph{Action} or
\emph{Transaction}, sometimes also \emph{Signal}, encapsulates a command in
form of an object. That way, operations can get parameterised; they can be put
in a queue, be made undone or traced in a log book. Figure \ref{command_figure}
shows the structure of the pattern.

Chapter \ref{state_and_logic_heading} uses the idea of representing operations
and algorithms (logic knowledge) as independent models, similar to encapsulated
commands.
