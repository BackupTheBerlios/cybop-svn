CYBOL Application Execution
___________________________

- Change into the base directoy of your cybol applications, e.g.:

    cd /home/cybop/examples

- Execute cyboi and give the "run.cybol" file of an application as argument, e.g.:

    /home/cybop/bin/cyboi --knowledge exit/run.cybol
    /home/cybop/bin/cyboi --knowledge exit_text_file/run.cybol
    /home/cybop/bin/cyboi --knowledge exit_cybol_file/run.cybol
    /home/cybop/bin/cyboi --knowledge shell_output/run.cybol
    /home/cybop/bin/cyboi --knowledge shell_command_execution/run.cybol
    /home/cybop/bin/cyboi --knowledge program_execution/run.cybol
