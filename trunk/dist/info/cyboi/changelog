cyboi (0.5.0.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Complete implementation of the loop operation
  * Correct bug in get_new_signal_id of signal_memory_accessor.c
  * Implement Web User Interface (WUI) handling by generating (translating) HTML from CYBOL (comparable to XUL/ UIML)
  * Extend sources for handing over string parameters in URL, using escape code sequences
  * Add url_refresh operation
  * Implement post operation for web communication
  * Add new abstraction knowledge for runtime access to knowledge model
  * Enable dynamically created logic models
  * Generalise handling of services using startup/ shutdown operations
  * Run tcp service in an own thread
  * Synchronise signal memory using Mutex
  * Use send operation for placing runtime signals read from a CYBOL source into the signal memory
  * Restructure source directories, following von Neumann architecture (controller, memory, computer, globals)
  * Remove /web directory (tcp procedures are now in receive_tcp_socket.c; client socket and signal numbers are in internals_memory_accessor.c)
  * Remove input_output_activator.c (now done by startup/ shutdown and receive/ interrupt/ send service calls in CYBOL)
  * Remove input_output_handler.c (activation/ blocking flags etc. are now created/ destroyed in corresponding startup/ shutdown procedure)

cyboi (0.4.0.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Move global variables and constants into special files
  * Use encapsulated primitives so that pointers
    can be handed through the system, instead of
    copies of char, int, double etc.;
    encapsulation is also necessary to preserve a
    primitive's value in memory -- otherwise, their value
    gets lost as soon as a parser procedure is left
  * Complete system lifecycle and waiting loop
  * Simplify configuration file which now consists
    of solely key-value pairs, on just one level,
    NOT hierarchically
  * Store configuration values internally in a simple
    pointer array instead of an extra data structure;
    it is not necessary to store additional type information
    in a second column of the internals memory, because
    internals are ALWAYS simple pointers to some date
    structure that was created outside the internals memory
  * Adapt whole system to new configuration handling
  * Factor out code from cyboi main function into separate
    files and procedures, for better overview
  * Change all get procedures in arrays, so that only references,
    but NOT copies are delivered back; change system accordingly
  * Change complete CYBOI system from unnecessary triple-referenced
    pointers to simple ones
  * Only hand over those variables as double reference which:
    * will carry a result to be delivered back
    * have to be treated as array
  * Remove signal from signal_memory only AFTER
    the signal has been handled
  * Correct A LOT OF bugs causing segmentation faults at runtime
  * Get Hello, World! application running

cyboi (0.3.1.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * changed handling of Internals
  * prepared TCP/IP Sockets

 -- Christian Heller <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>  Tue, 23 Nov 2004 15:00:00 +0100


cyboi (0.3.0.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Communication over Sockets
  * Reimplement compound model, according to new CYBOL structure
  * Continue XML parser, using libxml2 as temporary solution

 -- Christian Heller <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>  Mon, 13 Sep 2004 12:00:00 +0100


cyboi(0.2.2.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix several bugs in model handling
  * Create transient copies of all persistent sources, instead of pointing to persistent sources which get freed after some time which resulted in null pointers
  * Extend number of command line parameters, providing more options for running CYBOI
  * Enable reading of sources from inline and file location

 -- Christian Heller <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>  Wed, 23 Jun 2004 12:00:00 +0100


cyboi(0.2.1.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Correct determination of highest priority index in signal memory
  * Restructure project directories: /constants --> /constant; /model --> /array; /model --> /state; /statics --> /state; /dynamics --> /logic
  * Move operation (being state knowledge) to /state
  * Bundle all constants in just one place
  * Use more constants, instead of hard-coded values
  * Introduce constants for log messages
  * Improve logger; removed all dependencies from other project parts (like array)
  * Hand over size and count as parameters; do not keep them in one array with pointers
  * Prepare processing of compound signals
  * Factor out two procedures handle_create_model_signal and handle_send_signal from handle_operation_signal
  * Adapt create_model procedure to read cybol sources from several locations like inline|file|ftp
  * Add test procedures in an own testing module
  * Prepare processing of compound signals

cyboi(0.1.0.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * CYBOI is an interpreter that can read CYBOL files and create systems
  * Write CYBOI in Java
  * Catch events from Java AWT event queue
  * Use the Apache Xerces XML parser
  * Create static structures of instances in memory
  * Run dynamic loop catching signals from internal signal memory (queue)
  * Create GUI using Java Swing (as temporary workaround)
