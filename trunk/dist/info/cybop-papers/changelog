cyboi (0.4.0.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Move global variables and constants into special files
  * Use encapsulated primitives so that pointers
    can be handed through the system, instead of
    copies of char, int, double etc.;
    encapsulation is also necessary to preserve a
    primitive's value in memory -- otherwise, their value
    gets lost as soon as a parser procedure is left
  * Complete system lifecycle and waiting loop
  * Simplify configuration file which now consists
    of solely key-value pairs, on just one level,
    NOT hierarchically
  * Store configuration values internally in a simple
    pointer array instead of an extra data structure;
    it is not necessary to store additional type information
    in a second column of the internals memory, because
    internals are ALWAYS simple pointers to some date
    structure that was created outside the internals memory
  * Adapt whole system to new configuration handling
  * Factor out code from cyboi main function into separate
    files and procedures, for better overview
  * Change all get procedures in arrays, so that only references,
    but NOT copies are delivered back; change system accordingly
  * Change complete CYBOI system from unnecessary triple-referenced
    pointers to simple ones
  * Only hand over those variables as double reference which:
    * will carry a result to be delivered back
    * have to be treated as array
  * Remove signal from signal_memory only AFTER
    the signal has been handled
  * Correct A LOT OF bugs causing segmentation faults at runtime
  * Get Hello, World! application running
