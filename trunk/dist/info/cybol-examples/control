Description: Cybernetics Oriented Language (CYBOL) example applications
 The Cybernetics Oriented Programming (CYBOP) theory is a collection of new
 concepts for software design, which are taken from sciences like philosophy,
 psychology, physics or biology, and nature directly.
 It also incorporates the best ideas of Procedural-/ Object-/ Component-/
 Ontology-oriented programming.
 The concepts found their practical realisation in the Cybernetics Oriented
 Language (CYBOL) and the Cybernetics Oriented Interpreter (CYBOI).
 .
 CYBOL has not much in common with traditional programming languages.
 It is based on just one concept: Hierarchy. State- as well as logic models,
 also called knowledge, can be easily described by it.
 This includes Graphical-/ Textual-/ Web User Interfaces (GUI, TUI, WUI),
 domain models, communication models, algorithms and more.
 CYBOL can therefore also be called a universal knowledge modelling language.
 It hopes to attract not only classical programmers, but to enable domain
 experts to, themselves, actively participate in the development process.
 Its syntax is pure XML. It is truly platform-independent, absolutely flexible,
 extensible and changeable at runtime.
 .
 CYBOI is needed to execute application systems defined in CYBOL.
 It can be called a Virtual Machine (VM).
 Originally written in Java, it was later reimplemented in pure C.
 In the future, CYBOI may take over more and more Operating System (OS)
 functionality, to eventually become OS-independent.
 Further, many parts of it might get minimized so far, that they can be
 implemented in an assembler language.
 Finally, one might imagine to burn CYBOI into a hardware chip directly.
 .
 TODO: Although GUIs and other models can already be defined completely in
 CYBOL, they cannot be used by CYBOI yet. CYBOI currently contains socket- and
 web communication mechanisms, but still lacks support for GUI, TUI and other
 things more.
 .
 This package contains example applications written in the Cybernetics Oriented
 Language (CYBOL).
