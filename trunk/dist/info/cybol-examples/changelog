cyboi (0.4.0.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Move global variables and constants into special files
  * Use encapsulated primitives so that pointers
    can be handed through the system, instead of
    copies of char, int, double etc.;
    encapsulation is also necessary to preserve a
    primitive's value in memory -- otherwise, their value
    gets lost as soon as a parser procedure is left
  * Complete system lifecycle and waiting loop
  * Simplify configuration file which now consists
    of solely key-value pairs, on just one level,
    NOT hierarchically
  * Store configuration values internally in a simple
    pointer array instead of an extra data structure;
    it is not necessary to store additional type information
    in a second column of the internals memory, because
    internals are ALWAYS simple pointers to some date
    structure that was created outside the internals memory
  * Adapt whole system to new configuration handling
  * Factor out code from cyboi main function into separate
    files and procedures, for better overview
  * Change all get procedures in arrays, so that only references,
    but NOT copies are delivered back; change system accordingly
  * Change complete CYBOI system from unnecessary triple-referenced
    pointers to simple ones
  * Only hand over those variables as double reference which:
    * will carry a result to be delivered back
    * have to be treated as array
  * Remove signal from signal_memory only AFTER
    the signal has been handled
  * Correct A LOT OF bugs causing segmentation faults at runtime
  * Get Hello, World! application running

cyboi(0.2.2.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix several bugs in model handling
  * Create transient copies of all persistent sources, instead of pointing to persistent sources which get freed after some time which resulted in null pointers
  * Extend number of command line parameters, providing more options for running CYBOI
  * Enable reading of sources from inline and file location

cyboi(0.2.1.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Correct determination of highest priority index in signal memory
  * Restructure project directories: /constants --> /constant; /model --> /array; /model --> /state; /statics --> /state; /dynamics --> /logic
  * Move operation (being state knowledge) to /state
  * Bundle all constants in just one place
  * Use more constants, instead of hard-coded values
  * Introduce constants for log messages
  * Improve logger; removed all dependencies from other project parts (like array)
  * Hand over size and count as parameters; do not keep them in one array with pointers
  * Prepare processing of compound signals
  * Factor out two procedures handle_create_model_signal and handle_send_signal from handle_operation_signal
  * Adapt create_model procedure to read cybol sources from several locations like inline|file|ftp
  * Add test procedures in an own testing module
  * Prepare processing of compound signals

cyboi(0.2.0.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rewrite CYBOI in C programming language
  * Start writing or using an existing XML parser (like libxml)
  * Insert first graphics drawing routines (xlibs)

cyboi(0.1.0.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * CYBOI is an interpreter that can read CYBOL files and create systems
  * Write CYBOI in Java
  * Catch events from Java AWT event queue
  * Use the Apache Xerces XML parser
  * Create static structures of instances in memory
  * Run dynamic loop catching signals from internal signal memory (queue)
  * Create GUI using Java Swing (as temporary workaround)
