cyboi(0.2.2.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * New Release.
  * Fix several bugs in model handling 
  * Create transient copies of all persistent sources, instead of pointing to persistent sources which get freed after some time which resulted in null pointers 
  * Extend number of command line parameters, providing more options for running CYBOI 
  * Enable reading of sources from inline and file location

cyboi(0.2.1.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * New Release.
  * Correct determination of highest priority index in signal memory 
  * Restructure project directories: /constants --> /constant; /model --> /array; /model --> /state; /statics --> /state; /dynamics --> /logic 
  * Move operation (being state knowledge) to /state 
  * Bundle all constants in just one place 
  * Use more constants, instead of hard-coded values 
  * Introduce constants for log messages 
  * Improve logger; removed all dependencies from other project parts (like array) 
  * Hand over size and count as parameters; do not keep them in one array with pointers 
  * Prepare processing of compound signals 
  * Factor out two procedures handle_create_model_signal and handle_send_signal from handle_operation_signal 
  * Adapt create_model procedure to read cybol sources from several locations like inline|file|ftp 
  * Add test procedures in an own testing module 
  * Prepare processing of compound signals
