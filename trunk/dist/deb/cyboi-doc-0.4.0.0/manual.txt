1 Introduction
______________

The Cybernetics Oriented Interpreter (CYBOI) is a program that can process
knowledge models defined in the XML-based Cybernetics Oriented Language (CYBOL).

The theoretical concepts behind CYBOI and CYBOL are summarised by the name
Cybernetics Oriented Programming (CYBOP).

It is the aim of CYBOP to enable developers as well as users themselves to
write whole application systems in an absolutely flexible, platform-independent
way, using the CYBOL (XML) format.


2 Usage
_______

CYBOI cannot be started alone, without additional configuration information.
A special configuration file has to be given as command-line parameter,
for successful startup.

To run an application using CYBOI, just type in a shell/ console window:

cyboi configuration.cybol

A number of example applications can be found in /usr/share/doc/cyboi/examples.
To start one of them with CYBOI, change into the following directory:

cd /usr/share/doc/cyboi

Afterwards, type in a shell/console window:

cyboi examples/exit/configuration.cybol
cyboi examples/exit_text_file/configuration.cybol
cyboi examples/exit_cybol_file/configuration.cybol
cyboi examples/helloworld/configuration.cybol

Read the example CYBOL files to get more information!


3 Development
_____________

CYBOI is written in pure ANSI C, currently tested under Debian GNU/Linux Sarge
and in the CYGWIN environment under Windows.

It serves -- so to say -- as interface between a computer's hardware and the
application knowledge defined by some developer or user.

CYBOI is the active instance that controls the hardware as well as processes
the passive application knowledge.

CYBOI currently relies on the existance of an Operating System (OS), whose
hardware-driving functionality it uses. Over the years, CYBOI may take over
more and more OS functionality for hardware control and -- one day --
even replace the whole OS.

The CYBOP architecture looks as follows:
