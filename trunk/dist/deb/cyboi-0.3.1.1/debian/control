Description: Cybernetics Oriented Interpreter (CYBOI) for CYBOP
 CYBOI is the corresponding interpreter that is needed to execute systems
 defined in CYBOL.
 CYBOI was originally written in Java using the Swing graphics toolkit.
 The next step will be to rewrite it in pure C so that CYBOI and CYBOL
 can be added as truely free software to the Debian GNU/ Linux Distribution.
 The object oriented concepts are not lost hereby; CYBOL contains them.
 The only difficulty is the choice of an appropriate graphics toolkit.
 Temporarily, Gtk, Qt or wxWindows may be used. In the long run, however,
 CYBOI will have to provide its own graphics drawing routines to make full
 use of the hierarchical structures encoded in CYBOL.
 In the future, CYBOI might get minimized so far (by moving data structures
 to CYBOL) that it could be implemented in Assembler/ Machine Language.
 Further on, CYBOL/ XML will be the only remaining programming language
 and even whole operating systems will be written in CYBOL only.
 .
 CYBOP stands for Cybernetics Oriented Programming and is a collection
 of new concepts for software development, which are taken from nature.
 .
 CYBOL is an XML-based programming language and such completely 
 platform-independent. It incorporates the best ideas of 
 Procedural-/ Object-/ Component-/ Ontology-oriented programming.
