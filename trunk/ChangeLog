# The ChangeLog is an important file--it records the changes that are made to a package.
# The format of this file is quite strict (see section 5.5 Documentation and ChangeLogs).
#
# Here are some tips for ChangeLog writing:
# - make one entry per person
# - group logical changes together
# - separate logically distinct changes (change sets) by a single blank line
# - entries should be brief
# - an entry should not explain why a change was made, but rather what the change was
#   (the explanation of why belongs in the source code itself)

# This is the "Cybernetics Oriented Interpreter" (CYBOI).

        * automake.in (finish_languages): Only generate suffix rule
        when not doing dependency tracking.

        * m4/init.m4 (AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE): Use AM_MISSING_INSTALL_SH.
        * m4/missing.m4 (AM_MISSING_INSTALL_SH): New macro.

        * depend2.am: Use @SOURCE@, @OBJ@, @LTOBJ@, @OBJOBJ@,
        and @BASE@.  Always use -o.
