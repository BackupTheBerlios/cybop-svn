# This file records the changes that are made to cybop.
#
# The format of this file is quite strict. Here are some tips for ChangeLog writing:
# - make one entry per person
# - group logical changes together
# - separate logically distinct changes (change sets) by a single blank line
# - entries should be brief
# - an entry should not explain why a change was made, but rather what the change was
#   (the explanation of why belongs in the source code itself)

2008-03-19  Christian Heller  <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>
        * Debug "checker.c" by correcting a number of double-referenced pointer variables
        * Make "User Interface" example display the TUI again; key presses are not detected yet

2008-03-14  Christian Heller  <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>
        * Make "Hello, World!" example work again

2008-02-15  Christian Heller  <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>
        * Fix or temporarily commented out bugs in source code to make cyboi compilable again

2008-02-14  Christian Heller  <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>
        * Continue functions "receive_gnu_linux_console.c" and "gnu_linux_console_communicator.c"

2008-01-26  Christian Heller  <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>
        * Adapt modules "checker.c", "receive_gnu_linux_console.c",
            "read_gnu_linux_console.c", "decode_gnu_linux_console.c"

2007-12-28  Christian Heller  <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>
        * Adapt and optimise new functions in "applicator/sense"

2007-12-08  Christian Heller  <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>
        * Move suitable functions away from "sense_gnu_linux_console.c" into "gnu_linux_console_communicator.c"
            and add "ungetc" function right after "fgetc", to unread a detected character in the input stream,
            in order to make it available again to "read_gnu_linux_console"
        * Move suitable functions away from "sense_x_window_system.c" into "x_window_system_communicator.c"
            and only leave one function "XEventsQueued" to get notified of a key/ mouse event

2007-12-01  Christian Heller  <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>
        * Move suitable functions away from "sense_socket.c" into special communicator files, e.g.:
            "memoriser/communicator/datagram_socket_communicator.c"
        * Add warning log message to all top-level files containing only conditions, if no comparison matched:
            "accessor.c", "allocator.c", "communicator.c" etc.

2007-11-24  Christian Heller  <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>
        * Prepare merging of files in directory "controller/checker/" and remove directory again
        * Create files in new directory "applicator/sense/", by copying thread-specific content from "applicator/receive/"

2007-11-18  Christian Heller  <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>
        * Add new sub directory "controller/checker/" containing the new files
            "gnu_linux_console_interrupt_checker.c", "x_window_system_interrupt_checker.c",
            "www_service_interrupt_checker.c", "cyboi_service_interrupt_checker.c"

2007-11-17  Christian Heller  <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>
        * Add new interrupt variables for gnu/linux console, x window system, www service and cyboi service
            and store these in internal memory; these irqs are set when some signal arrives via tui, gui, wui
        * Adapt files "manager.c", "initialiser.c", "checker.c"

2007-10-30  Christian Heller  <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>
        * Determine body count at first, before adding it to http header in "http_response_converter.c"
        * Delete a number of outdated functions
        * Add temporary "dirty" changes to make http request and response back to the same client socket run for the first time
            (e.g. misuse the signal id to forward the client socket as parameter attached to the signal)
        * Merge all "applicator/interrupt/interrupt_*.c" files into "applicator/interrupt.c"
        * Adapt "applicator/shutdown/shutdown_*.c" files accordingly
        * Delete directory "applicator/interrupt/" recursively

2007-10-15  Christian Heller  <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>
        * Debug "startup_socket.c" so that buffer size is initialised first,
            before allocating the buffer; this bug caused the following error
            when deallocating the character buffer in "shutdown_socket.c":
            *** glibc detected *** free(): invalid next size (fast): 0x080d6198 ***
                Aborted

2007-10-14  Christian Heller  <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>
        * Hand over thread identification and thread interrupt as parameters,
            in all shutdown- and interrupt functions

2007-10-03  Christian Heller  <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>
        * Add correct LOG_LEVEL constant to all log messages of all source code files,
            so that the correct prefix (information, warning, error, debug) appears
        * Delete "Information: " etc. which were sometimes written directly into the log message
        * Rename "log_message_debug" function to "log_terminated_message" and require
            the log level as additional parameter
        * Eliminate "malloc" function from "logger.c", since the logger is also called from threads
            and memory allocation would result in an error like:
                *** glibc detected *** malloc(): memory corruption (fast): 0x080e0470 ***
                Aborted

2007-10-02  Christian Heller  <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>
        * Extract loop body of "check" function in module "checker.c" and split it into the four functions:
            "check", "check_signal", "check_handle", "check_wait", in order to gain more clearity

2007-09-20  Christian Heller  <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>
        * Add file "cyboi_identification_constants.c" and insert some renamed constants, taken from "log_message_constants.c"

2007-09-19  Christian Heller  <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>
        * Add new files: "unicode_character_encoding_constants.c", "utf_8_unicode_character_converter.c",
            "utf_16_unicode_character_converter.c" and adapt "converter.c" accordingly

2007-09-18  Christian Heller  <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>
        * Replace value "(int*) NULL_POINTER_ARRAY" in initialisation of global variables with "NUMBER_0_INTEGER_ARRAY";
            the old initialisation was actually a void** casted to an int* and therefore not correct, even if it was working

2007-09-17  Christian Heller  <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>
        * Rename "get_new_signal_id" to "get_new_signal_identification"
        * Clean up "get_new_signal_identification" and add "set_new_signal_identification" function in "signal_memory_accessor.c"
        * Correct wrong references to local variables like &p3, that get destroyed when a function is left, in function "set_signal"
        * Forward signal priority and -identification as references in functions:
            handle, handle_compound, handle_operation, loop, branch etc.
        * Eliminate signal identification creation wherever a new signal is generated,
            and use integer constants instead; the reason is that allocations are not
            allowed in threads (linux console, x window system, tcp sockets with http requests etc.);
            if the threads allocated a "signal identification" value, this would result in an error like:
                *** glibc detected *** malloc(): memory corruption (fast): 0x080e0470 ***
                Aborted
        * Remove special "prefix key" that had been introduced accidentially some days ago;
            the "get_universal_compound_element_by_name" function uses the full name given,
            if it does not contain the prefixes "." or "#"; therefore, a special prefix
            variable does not have to be created at socket startup, nor be handed over to the thread

2007-09-16  Christian Heller  <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>
        * Use an extra http receive model part (defined as cybol name constant) for
            (1) http request "method" and (2) "action" parameter in "http_request_converter.c"

2007-09-15  Christian Heller  <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>
        * Debug "http_request_converter.c"
        * Add new cybol name- and cybol model constants for http request
        * Add a "prefixed key" parameter that is necessary to add a prefix "." or "#" to the parameter name;
            it is created at socket startup and forwarded to the "receive_socket.c" thread

2007-09-14  Christian Heller  <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>
        * Mention parameters (as defined in CYBOL specification) in comment block of all operations in "applicator" directory
        * Debug "http_request_converter.c"

2007-09-10  Christian Heller  <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>
        * Synchronise xdt fields in "xdt_field_constants.c" and "xdt_converter.c"
            (function "decode_xdt_select_field" at "decode_xdt_decode_model" function calls)
        * Set correct abstractions in "xdt_converter.c"
            (function "decode_xdt_select_field" at "decode_xdt_decode_model" function calls)
        * Add new autoconf/ automake files prepared by Didier Link <didier@famille-link.fr>

2007-09-06  Christian Heller  <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>
        * Add xDT/GDT constants to files "xdt_record_constants.c", "xdt_record_name_constants.c",
            "xdt_field_constants.c", "xdt_field_name_constants.c", "xdt_converter.c"

2007-09-05  Christian Heller  <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>
        * Split file "xdt_field_name_constants.c" and create new files "xdt_record_name_constants.c" and "xdt_package_name_constants.c"
        * Add yet missing constants to file "xdt_field_name_constants.c"
        * Add yet missing conditions with new constants in "xdt_converter.c"

2007-08-31  Christian Heller  <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>
        * Add yet missing constants to "xdt_field_constants.c", taken from specification "BDT-Satzbeschreibung"

2007-08-29  Christian Heller  <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>
        * Add "uri_separator_constants.c"
        * Continue "receive_socket.c"
        * Complete first working version of "http_request_converter.c":
            Decode http request line, headers and body, and add the entries to the given model

2007-08-24  Christian Heller  <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>
        * Complete "html_character_entity_constants.c"
        * Replace hard-coded characters with their hexadecimal code in "character_constants.c"
        * Continue "http_request_converter.c"

2007-08-23  Christian Heller  <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>
        * Use new http separator constants instead of hard-coded characters in "http_response_converter.c"

2007-08-22  Christian Heller  <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>
        * Add "http_separator_constants.c"
        * Continue "http_response_converter.c" and "http_request_converter.c" and adapt "send_socket.c" to changes

2007-08-21  Christian Heller  <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>
        * Adapt "receive.c" and "receive_socket.c" by handing over new parameters: model, details, language

2007-08-20  Christian Heller  <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>
        * Create:
            "html_character_entity_reference_constants.c"
            "xml_character_entity_reference_constants.c"
            "character_entity_reference_converter.c"
        * Rename:
            "html_character_constants.c" to "numeric_character_reference_constants.c"
            "html_character_converter.c" to "numeric_character_reference_converter.c"

2007-08-16  Christian Heller  <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>
        * Delete "memoriser/mapper" directory and move/rename all files into "memoriser/converter"
        * Replace converter's "parse" and "serialise" function names with more neutral "decode" and "encode"
        * Introduce new global variables for setting the "sleep" loop times in "checker.c" and "receive_x_window_system.c"
        * Delete "variables.c" and move its content into new files:
            "primitive_type_size_variables.c", "thread_identification_variables.c",
            "service_interrupt_variables.c", "reallocation_factor_variables.c",
            "log_variables.c", "sleep_time_variables.c"

2007-08-15  Christian Heller  <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>
        * Delete "cyboi_constants.c" and move its content into new files:
            "cyboi_operation_mode_constants.c", "cyboi_signal_priority_constants.c"
        * Delete "system_constants.c" and move its content into new files:
            "system_file_name_constants.c" and "system_executable_constants.c"
        * Replace "INVALID_VALUE" constant in all source code with "NUMBER_MINUS_1_INTEGER",
            since that value is always context-related anyway
        * Make variables of array- and file reallocation factors, that were formerly
            defined as constants in "memory_structure_constants";
            move new variables into "variables.c";
            adapt file "globaliser.c" with variable initialisations accordingly

2007-08-14  Christian Heller  <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>
        * Complete "url_escape_code_mapper.c" and "html_character_mapper.c"

2007-08-13  Christian Heller  <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>

        * Replace all integer numbers like 0, 1 etc. with the corresponding constant *NUMBER_0_INTEGER, *NUMBER_1_INTEGER etc.
        * Remove "get_index_in_array" function and replace with "get_array_elements_index" function, wherever it was used
        * Clean up source code a bit, deleting outdated comments etc.

2007-08-12  Christian Heller  <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>

        * Add "url_escape_code_constants.c", "url_escape_code_mapper.c", "url_escape_code_converter.c"
        * Add "http_request_converter.c", "http_response_converter.c"
        * Add "html_character_constants.c", "html_character_mapper.c"

2007-08-04  Christian Heller  <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>

        * Continue to work through and update file "applicator/receive/receive_socket.c"
        * Comment out "#include <GL/freeglut.h>" in file "controller/tester.c",
            as including "glut.h" of the official xorg glut package suffices
            (hint from  Didier Link <didier@famille-link.fr>)

2007-08-03  Christian Heller  <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>

        * Adapt "applicator/send/send_socket.c" to wrap xhtml messages as http body with http protocol, status code and headers
        * Add "globals/constants/character/character_set_constants.c" file
        * Add "globals/constants/file_extension/" directory with one file containing text file extension constants
        * Add "globals/constants/http/http_header_constants.c" file
        * Add "globals/constants/http/http_header_variable_constants.c" file
        * Add "globals/constants/mime_type/" directory with 15 files containing mime type constants

2007-07-31  Christian Heller  <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>

        * Add "meta" property (a CYBOL model containing details) to "receive" operation, which is needed for creating HTML tags from CYBOL

2007-07-30  Christian Heller  <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>

        * Adapt all example applications to property name changes
        * Fix forgotten casts of parameters handed over to "receive_file_system", in function "receive_message"
        * Fix forgotten model allocation in workaround section of function "parse_compound_cybol_node"
        * Split function "parse_compound_cybol_properties" by extracting loop body
        * Split function "parse_compound_cybol_nodes" by extracting loop body

2007-07-27  Christian Heller  <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>

        * Clean up and correct "receive_file_system" function
        * Put loop body of "parse_compound_cybol_node" into extra function
        * Put loop body of "handle_compound" into extra function "handle_compound_part"

2007-07-23  Christian Heller  <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>

        * Adapt applicator/create.c function
        * Move some constants from globals/constants/cybol/cybol_abstraction_constants.c
            to globals/constants/memory_structure/array_constants.c and globals/constants/memory_structure/memory_abstraction_constants.c
        * Add "memoriser/mapper/abstraction_mapper.c"
        * Change "receive_file_system_model" into "parse" function, in compound_converter.c
        * Delete xml_converter.c, translator.c, cybol_translator.c, xdt_translator.c
        * Merge cybol_translator.c into compound_converter.c
        * Merge xml_converter.c into compound_converter.c
        * Adapt properties of "receive" operation: rename "abstraction" into "language", add "message" and delete superfluous ones;
            mind the change in meaning of the "model" property, which now labels an existing,
            empty model that was created before and is to be filled in the "receive" operation

2007-07-19  Christian Heller  <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>

        * Rename "abstraction" property of "create" operation into "language" and delete superfluous property constants
        * Implement checks in "compound_accessor.c" to avoid segmentation fault when trying to retrieve
            a compound element with empty name and abstraction "knowledge" or "encapsulated"

2007-07-15  Christian Heller  <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>

        * Remove reading of "enable" property in handler.c again;
            the CYBOL "branch" operation may now be used to branch the program flow (conditional execution);
            it is NOT necessary anymore to have an "enable" property for logic models (operations)
            in order to be executed only if that property is set to "true"
        * Adapt example CYBOL applications accordingly

2007-07-12  Christian Heller  <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>

        * Extend applicator/receive/receive_file_system.c so that details may be given as parameter
            (for example, this is necessary when creating an HTML table row of a web user interface,
            because the HTML tag has to be given as property = meta data in this case)

2007-06-29  Christian Heller  <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>

        * Rename controller/manager/initial_signal_manager.c into controller/initialiser.c
            and move source code for initial signal there
        * Read "enable" property for all operations in handler.c;
            CAUTION! ALL logic models (operations) have to have an "enable" property
            now and are only executed, if that property is set to "true";
            this is necessary for using conditional execution, depending on a flag

2007-06-28  Christian Heller  <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>

        * Add new cybol operations for comparing strings: all, prefix, suffix, part
        * Implement enable flag for all signals (operations), in order to handle conditional execution

2007-06-24  Christian Heller  <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>

        * Add new operation 'get'
        * Rename equally named function in accessor.c and all code to 'get_element'
        * Rename 'set' function to 'set_element' in all code, in order to be uniform

2007-06-22  Christian Heller  <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>

        * Replace "Linux" symbol names in all project and source files with "GNU/Linux"; see:
            http://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html

2007-06-16  Christian Heller  <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>

        * Add new or extend operations like copy, count, compare etc.
        * Extend send_shell function with line_feed option
        * Update loop function

2007-05-28  Christian Heller  <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>

        * Release cybop 0.8.0, including: CYBOP theory documentation, CYBOL specification and examples, CYBOI interpreter program

2007-05-26  Christian Heller  <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>

        * Restructure cyboi command line argument handling to allow for dynamic log file, log level etc.
        * Move log_message_constants.c to new directory and split away log_level_constants.c and log_level_name_constants.c; adapt all source code files
        * Add opengl startup and shutdown

2007-05-24  Christian Heller  <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>

        * Add opengl/ mesa libraries to makefile

2007-05-16  Christian Heller  <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>

        * Update cybol example applications

        * Move away NULL_POINTER from "variables.c" into an own file "pointer_constants.c"
        * Change NULL_POINTER so that it is now a void**, pointing to an array containing just a null void pointer;
            Change NULL_POINTER values in all source code into *NULL_POINTER
            Change &NULL_POINTER values in all source code into NULL_POINTER

2007-05-15  Christian Heller  <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>

        * Fix error in gnu_linux_console_converter serialisation that caused the tui to crash (integer vector elements were read as pointers, not integers)
        * Start searching error that null pointers do not keep their value in pointer arrays; included debug log messages

2007-05-10  Christian Heller  <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>

        * Fix bug with integer parsing and -serialisation

2007-05-09  Christian Heller  <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>

        * Add name, name count, name size to functions "get_compound_element_by_name" and "get_universal_compound_element_by_name"
        * Adjust all source code by adding name parameters to these function calls

        * Fix bug that pointer vector instead of integer vector was used
        * Adjust comma characters to be added only if one element already exists in the destination array

2007-05-08  Christian Heller  <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>

        * Add "fflush" wherever a stream is output to a file, in order to not delay the output to an arbitrary system event

2007-05-01  Christian Heller  <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>

        * Correct bug that details model was not always created when reading a part from a CYBOL file that did not have details;
            but a details compound ALWAYS has to be allocated, because at runtime, properties might be added as details to a part model;
            this was changed in the cybol_translator.c file

2007-04-26  Christian Heller  <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>

        * Complete "model_diagram_converter.c"
        * Add "name" parameters to "get_compound_element_by_index" function and adapt all code

        * Make compound element names in "add_compound_element_by_name" function receive an enumerated index suffix
        * Adapt "xdt_converter.c" accordingly, using the "add_compound_element_by_name" function

2007-03-18  Christian Heller  <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>

        * Complete xdt_converter
        * Fix xdt parsing problem

2007-03-17  Christian Heller  <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>

        * Correct some bugs in xdt parser (for example, temporary pointers local to function
            were returned and of course null as soon as the function was left)

2007-03-16  Christian Heller  <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>

        * Rename "bdt" into "xdt"
        * Complete first (buggy) version of xdt_converter

2007-01-14  Christian Heller  <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>

        * Make ipv4 socket send/ receive connections work not only among two processes, e.g. from shell to shell,
            but also from a web browser sending a request to a cyboi service;
            the problem was that port numbers had not been converted from host- into network byte order;
            host addresses were already converted properly

        * Change year in copyright statement of all source code files

2007-01-11  Christian Heller  <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>

        * Continue socket send procedure
        * Test functionality

2006-12-27  Christian Heller  <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>

        * Extend and rename socket handling

2006-09-09  Christian Heller  <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>

        * Release cyboi 0.7.0
        * Add <i>libpthread</i> library to Makefile, for linking
        * Add minor things to Makefile, for GNU/Linux-Windows platform compilations,
            so that conditional preprocessor directives like:
            <i>#ifdef LINUX_OPERATING_SYSTEM</i> can be used in the source code
        * Implement x window system gui event handling
        * Update and add more things for wide character handling
        * Investigate CPU idle mechanisms including: <i>pause</i>, <i>sleep</i> and system signals
            --> the decision fell on a simple <i>sleep</i> loop for reasons explained in the code;<br>
            change signal <i>wait</i> loop to become blocking, that is to react only to interrupts;
            this avoids wasting system resources (CPU activity) as it happened up to now
        * Implement threads using mutexes (atomic flags) for reception of signals via x window system and gnu linux console (terminal)
        * Exit threads using the USR1 operating system signal
        * Prepare access to meta elements of a compound double hierarchy and completely restructure
            <i>memoriser/accessor/compound_accessor.c</i><br>
            two knowledge tree separators are now possible: the part separator <i>.</i> and the meta separator <i>#</i>
        * Restructure "memoriser/accessor/compound_accessor.c" once more; the three procedures:<br>
            1 set_compound_element_by_name<br>
            2 remove_compound_element_by_name<br>
            3 get_compound_element_by_name<br>
            do now not only get handed over the <i>compound model</i>,
            but also the corresponding <i>compound details</i> (meta information)
            -- that way, meta properties can be determined properly
            (which was done wrong before, as the properties were searched
            in the <i>compound model</i> instead of in the <i>compound details</i>
        * Merge two procedures "get_compound_element_by_encapsulated_name" and "get_real_compound_element_by_name"<br>
            - rename this new, merged procedure to "get_universal_compound_element_by_name"<br>
            - adapt all source code to new procedure<br>
            - change all places where logic parameters were retrieved with "get_compound_element_by_name" to the new "get_universal_compound_element_by_name"<br>
            - this means that from now on, CYBOL knowledge templates can be written much more flexibly, since models can be given as<br>
            1 hard-coded inline value<br>
            2 hierarchical name to a model (= encapsulated model)<br>
            3 hierarchical name pointing to another hierarchical name containing a model (= double-encapsulated model)
        * Add unix shell command processing from within CYBOL
        * Factor out <i>copy</i> procedures for single types into an own <i>applicator/copy/</i> directory
        * Fix hard-to-find bug that colour values were not always copied correctly for the textual user interface (tui);
            the reson is that, when copying a colour value, the destination array ALWAYS has to be resized,
            no matter whether it is greater or smaller than the source array;
            otherwise, some suffixes may be left at the end of a newly copied colour and make that colour unknown/ unusable
        * Rework textual user interface (tui) handling; introduce windowing technique
        * Correct bug that tui is walking right and down when sending it several times:<br>
            the reason was that the original value coming from cybol was manipulated,
            when calculating the coordinates according to the given layout;
            copies are used instead now, so that the original tui parameters are stable
        * Implement selective repaint; small areas instead of the whole textual user interface (tui) can be repainted now
        * Implement <i>clear</i> as property to the <i>send</i> operation, so that the tui is not cleared every time, only if wanted
        * Add <i>enter</i> (carriage return, line feed) and <i>escape</i> character handling for tui
        * Decrease sleep time from 1 to 0.1 --> much better performance, but processor is more busy now :-|
        * Comment out my own implementation of fork/ execv/ wait, which did not work reliably for running external processes;<br>
            probably, there are some conflicts with the threads/ mutexes/ signal checker loop used in CYBOI;<br>
            for now, the <i>system</i> function is used to run external commands/ programs in an own child process;<br>
            this even has the advantage of better portability between platforms :-)
        * Rename <i>create</i> function to "<i>receive_file_system</i> function;<br>
            prepare <i>receive_file_system</i> procedure for receiving various file formats:<br>
            this is to foresee coming file format conversions when receiving (loading) or sending (saving) files;<br>
            this may be done on the local file system or over a remote connection
        * Eliminate bug that <i>compound</i> logic models were not processed;
            --> the reason was that <i>cybol</i> was given as abstraction in CYBOL
            so that the abstraction at runtime still was <i>cybol</i> instead of <i>compound</i>;
            therefore, rename/ merge all <i>cybol</i> abstractions into <i>compound</i>
        * Eliminate bug at shutdown: when shutting down the x window system service,
            CYBOI tried to remove some entries from the internal memory,
            which moved all other entries one place forward in that memory,
            so that none of the pointers pointed to the correct place anymore
        * Extend signal handler by enabling processing of signals with abstractions <i>encapsulated_knowledge</i>
            and <i>knowledge</i>, in addition to the already existing abstractions <i>compound</i> and <i>operation</i>
        * Check and correct interrupting (exiting) of <i>receive</i> service threads
        * Interrupt (exit) and free resources of all <i>receive</i> service threads automatically at
            system shutdown, which is necessary in case a CYBOL application developer forgot to do that
        * Factor out some manager code into the new procedures <i>startup_internal_memory</i> and <i>startup_system_signal_handler</i>
        * Check for an existing thread first, before creating a new one;<br>
            when a <i>receive</i> procedure is called more than once,
            for example to hand over a new command set to wait for and receive,
            a new thread MUST NOT be created every time
        * Add a number of new model constants (boolean operations, bit manipulation operations etc.)
        * Remove CYBOL_ABSTRACTION everywhere and replace with COMPOUND_ABSTRACTION, which existed in parallel

        * Release cybol 1.1.0
        * Add EBNF and XSD schema files
        * Add new CYBOL example applications

        * Release cybop 1.1.0
        * Add "Linux World" 2005 poster
            Authors: Christian Heller <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>
        * Add "Reflexions on Knowledge Modelling" 2006 paper
            Authors: Christian Heller <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>

2005-08-30  Christian Heller  <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>

        * Release cyboi 0.6.0
        * Update debian package files using multi-binary packages
        * Prepare terminal handling of Textual User Interfaces (TUI); (see Zemljanka and TurboVision)
        * Debug many errors caused by NULL_POINTER checks which tested the variables instead of their dereferenced values
            wrong: if (a != NULL_POINTER)
            right: if (*a != NULL_POINTER)
            this caused knowledge models not to be created/ added to the knowledge root/ whole model
        * Replace NULL_POINTER with &NULL_POINTER, where a local void** variable is initialised
        * Remove all const keywords before static variables and before parameters in headers of procedures, for less code, improved readability and because the const keyword is considered useless now:
            pointers that were handed over do mostly not get manipulated directly anyway, only pointers within the array pointed to
            arrays defined with = {} are constant anyway
        * Delete all character counts and replace them with just one count constant
        * Change and unify all comparisons, so that their if expressions now compare for equality with 0 instead of 1
        * Replace constant count variables with the already existing integer counts, to save redundant code and also some memory, e.g.:
            static const int COMMA_CHARACTER_COUNT_ARRAY[] = {1};
            static const int* COMMA_CHARACTER_COUNT = COMMA_CHARACTER_COUNT_ARRAY;
            replaced with:
            static const int* COMMA_CHARACTER_COUNT = NUMBER_1_INTEGER_ARRAY;
        * Delete superfluous source files for primitives; only vectors are used now everywhere
        * Rename string to character vector
        * Simplify source code by replacing POINTER_NULL_POINTER, INTEGER_NULL_POINTER, FILE_NULL_POINTER etc. in all source files with just NULL_POINTER
        * Replace allocate_integer and others with more general procedure allocate
        * Prepare send_terminal procedure for tui output
        * Rename low-level receive/ send into read/ write, to better distinguish them from the high-level receive/ send CYBOL operations
        * Rename low-level create/ destroy into allocate/ deallocate, to better distinguish them from the high-level create/ destroy CYBOL operations
        * Rename file set.c to copy.c
        * Add knowledge memory and signal memory to internal memory; this HAS TO BE DONE, because when using threads, ONLY ONE parameter (the internal memory) can be handed over to these
        * Hand over internal memory, knowledge memory and signal memory as parameters, instead of reading them every time from internal_memory
        * Rename internals_memory to internal_memory
        * Adapt some include paths and procedure names after restructuring
        * Delete memory managers and put code into general manager.c
        * Write log messages to a file instead of to console
        * Replace all American English (e.g. lize suffixes) with British (Commonwealth) English (e.g. lise) which is now consistently used throughout all source code
        * Move directories communicator, converter and translator from parent directory controller to parent directory memoriser
        * Rename directory computer to applicator
        * Restructure source code directories in relation to von Neumann computer architecture, i.e. consisting of the parts:
            memoriser (Memory, containing states)
            controller (Control Unit, coordinating flow)
            applicator (Algorithmic Logic Unit = ALU, containing logic)
            globals (additional, global constants and variables)
            tester (additional, for testing)

        * Release cybol 1.0.0
        * Change package structure to better comply with debian maintainer guidelines

2005-06-27  Christian Heller  <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>

        * Release cyboi 0.5.0.0
        * Add Makefile and exclude file for compilation
        * Move some paragraphs and change a few formulations in documentation
        * Complete implementation of the loop operation
        * Correct bug in get_new_signal_id of signal_memory_accessor.c
        * Implement Web User Interface (WUI) handling by generating (translating) HTML from CYBOL (comparable to XUL/ UIML)
        * Extend sources for handing over string parameters in URL, using escape code sequences
        * Add url_refresh operation
        * Implement post operation for web communication
        * Add new abstraction knowledge for runtime access to knowledge model
        * Enable dynamically created logic models
        * Generalise handling of services using startup/ shutdown operations
        * Run tcp service in an own thread
        * Synchronise signal memory using Mutex
        * Use send operation for placing runtime signals read from a CYBOL source into the signal memory
        * Restructure source directories, following von Neumann architecture (controller, memory, computer, globals)
        * Remove /web directory (tcp procedures are now in receive_tcp_socket.c; client socket and signal numbers are in internals_memory_accessor.c)
        * Remove input_output_activator.c (now done by startup/ shutdown and receive/ interrupt/ send service calls in CYBOL)
        * Remove input_output_handler.c (activation/ blocking flags etc. are now created/ destroyed in corresponding startup/ shutdown procedure)

        * Release cybop 1.0.0
        * Add "Untersuchung der Realisierungsmoeglichkeiten von CYBOL-Webfrontends,
            unter Verwendung von Konzepten des Cybernetics Oriented Programming (CYBOP)"
            paper and presentation

2005-02-28  Christian Heller  <christian.heller@tuxtax.de>

        * Release cyboi 0.4.0.0
        * Add first minimal CYBOI documentation manual (simple text file)
        * Move global variables and constants into special files
        * Use encapsulated primitives so that pointers
            can be handed through the system, instead of
            copies of char, int, double etc.;
            encapsulation is also necessary to preserve a
            primitive's value in memory -- otherwise, their value
            gets lost as soon as a parser procedure is left
        * Complete system lifecycle and waiting loop
        * Simplify configuration file which now consists
            of solely key-value pairs, on just one level,
            NOT hierarchically
        * Store configuration values internally in a simple
            pointer array instead of an extra data structure;
            it is not necessary to store additional type information
            in a second column of the internals memory, because
            internals are ALWAYS simple pointers to some date
            structure that was created outside the internals memory
        * Adapt whole system to new configuration handling
        * Factor out code from cyboi main function into separate
            files and procedures, for better overview
        * Change all get procedures in arrays, so that only references,
            but NOT copies are delivered back; change system accordingly
        * Change complete CYBOI system from unnecessary triple-referenced
            pointers to simple ones
        * Only hand over those variables as double reference which:
            * will carry a result to be delivered back
            * have to be treated as array
        * Remove signal from signal_memory only AFTER
            the signal has been handled
