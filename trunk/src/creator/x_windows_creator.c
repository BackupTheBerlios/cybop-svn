 *
 * A session (display) manager shows a graphical user login,
 * in which it offers a list of window managers to chose from.
 *
 * A window manager cares about all windows displayed on a screen.
 * This includes the resizing, moving, stacking or tiling of windows.
 *
 * CYBOI aims to become both at the same time,
 * a session- (display-) as well as a window manager.
