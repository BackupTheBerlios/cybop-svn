 * This is an array.
 *
 * It represents an area in the computer's memory that can contain a number of
 * abstract elements.
 *
 * An abstraction simplifies and represents a real world item.
 * In the case of computer science, everything gets abstracted to 0 and 1.
 * But that also means that every abstraction has a bytecode representation.
