//
// In computing, UTF-16 (16-bit Unicode Transformation Format) is a variable-
// length character encoding for Unicode, capable of encoding the entire
// Unicode repertoire.
//
// The encoding form maps code points (characters) into a sequence of 16-bit
// words, called code units. For characters in the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP),
// the resulting encoding is a single 16-bit word. For characters in the other
// planes, the encoding will result in a pair of 16-bit words, together called
// a surrogate pair. All possible code points from U+0000 through U+10FFFF, except
// for the surrogate code points U+D800ï¿½U+DFFF, are uniquely mapped by UTF-16
// regardless of the code point's current or future character assignment or use.
//
// As many uses in computing require units of bytes (octets), there are three
// related encoding schemes which map to octet sequences instead of words:
// namely UTF-16, UTF-16BE, and UTF-16LE. They differ only in the byte order
// chosen to represent each 16-bit unit and whether they make use of a
// Byte Order Mark (BOM). All of the schemes will result in either a 2 or 4-byte
// sequence for any given character.
//
// UTF-16 is officially defined in Annex Q of the international standard
// ISO/IEC 10646-1. It is also described in The Unicode Standard version 3.0
// and higher, as well as in the IETF's RFC 2781.
//
// UCS-2 (2-byte Universal Character Set) is an obsolete character encoding
// which is a predecessor to UTF-16. The UCS-2 encoding form is nearly
// identical to that of UTF-16, except that it does not support surrogate pairs
// and therefore can only encode characters in the BMP range U+0000 through U+FFFF.
// As a consequence it is a fixed-length encoding that always encodes characters
// into a single 16-bit value. As with UTF-16, there are three related encoding schemes:
// UCS-2, UCS-2BE, UCS-2LE, that map characters to a specific byte sequence.
//
// Because of the technical similarities and upwards compatibility from UCS-2
// to UTF-16, the two encodings are often erroneously conflated and used as if
// interchangeable, so that strings encoded in UTF-16 are sometimes misidentified
// as being encoded in UCS-2.
//
// For both UTF-16 and UCS-2, all 65,536 code points contained within the BMP
// (Plane 0), excluding the 2,048 special surrogate code points, are assigned
// to code units in a one-to-one correspondence with the 16-bit non-negative
// integers with the same values. Thus code point U+0000 is encoded as the
// number 0, and U+FFFF is encoded as 65535 (which is FFFF16 in hexadecimal).
