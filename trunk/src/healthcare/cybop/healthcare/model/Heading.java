/**
 * This class represents a heading.<br><br>
 *
 * It is a super class and forms an own level in the framework's domain ontology:
 *  <ul>
 *      <li>HealthRecord</li>
 *      <li>Unit</li>
 *      <li>Heading</li>
 *      <li>Description</li>
 *      <li>Principle</li>
 *  </ul>
 *
 * A heading corresponds to a paragraph.
 *
 * The OpenEHR specification describes heading as:<br>
 * "Structural information concepts whose purpose is to organise information
 * according to norms of practice, in the same way as headings in a paper document."
