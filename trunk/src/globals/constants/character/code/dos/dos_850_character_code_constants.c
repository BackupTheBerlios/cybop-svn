//
// A "Character Set" consists of three parts:
// - Character Repertoire: a, b, c etc., e.g. ISO 8859-1 with 256 characters and Unicode with ~ 1 Mio. characters
// - Character Code: table assigning numbers, e.g. a = 97, b = 98, c = 99 etc.
// - Character Encoding: storing code numbers in Bytes, e.g. 97 = 01100001, 98 = 01100010, 99 = 01100011 etc.
//
// This file contains dos-850 character code constants.
//

//?? TODO: Add dos character codes here!
//?? Add further files for other character codes in this directory!
