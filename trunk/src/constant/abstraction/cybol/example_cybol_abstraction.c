//
// The CYBOL abstraction constants' names and values have been adapted to follow
// the style of the Internet media type / content type that is also
// known under the name Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME).
// These types are managed by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).
// See document "Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part Two: Media Types":
// http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2046
//
// Since the MIME standard does not offer media types for certain data,
// CYBOL had to invent new languages (media types), e.g. for dates, numbers etc.
// This is not meant to pollute the MIME standard, just to fill a gap!
// In case IANA adopts these extensions one day -- fine.
// If, however, other media type values replacing ours are proposed,
// we are open to adapt the CYBOL language specification accordingly.
//

//
// Example.
//
// IANA media type: example
//

/**
 * The example cybol abstraction.
 *
 * This is just offered by IANA for testing reasons.
