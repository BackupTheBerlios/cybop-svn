test

        * Reactivate loop in function "read_gnu_linux_console" (which was blocking the program flow),
            because escape sequences consist of more than one characters (mostly three)
        * Find some way to predict the number of characters or find an eof or the like,
            in order to properly handle escape control sequences

        * stop thread if irq has already been set to 1; only continue sensing if irq is 0,
            e.g. in function "sense_gnu_linux_console"
        * possibly also wait some time while irq is 0, not only while irq is 1

        * Set "receive" model in internal memory to NULL in "interrupt" (stop sensing) function,
            but do NOT destroy, since it belongs to the knowledge model tree
        * Edit "receive_message" function:
            ?? The following is possibly NOT correct anymore, as the handler is already represented by a receive operation!
            - Call the "handle" function handing over the command determined before
                (do this DIRECTLY, just like the "loop" and "branch" functions do,
                and NOT in form of an encapsulating signal)

        * Create new "set", "remove", "get" functions which automatically adjust the destination's count and size
            (see module "character_vector_accessor.c")

        * Replace redundant standard functions (arrays, set_elements etc.) with some sort of TEMPLATE replacing the type;
            this could save hundreds of lines of code; possible use a C++ compiler just because of this reason?

--

        * Continue debugging in function "check_signal" of module "checker.c":
            - UI example key presses are not detected yet
            - implement in parallel "receive" for gnu/linux console, x window system, socket
            - NEW IDEA: hand over "receive" knowledge model as "handler" property of the "sense" operation in CYBOL!
                --> then just call this knowledge model, no matter what it is
                --> advantage: properties (like a compound structure to store commands)
                    exist as details in the "receive" knowledge model

        * Commands of gnu/linux console MUESSEN uebergeben werden
        * Suche nach gedrueckter Taste in commands
        * Wenn returned command == NULL, dann suche nach "default" in commands
            (ist Aktion zum Einfuegen von Zeichen an aktueller Cursor-Position im CYBOI knowledge model)
        * Gedruecktes Zeichen/ Taste muss mit in einem Parameter zurueckgegeben werden!

        * Continue with: "receive_message" function in "check_signal()" of module "checker.c";
            Rest of "receive_message" function is o.k.
        * Adapt modules: "controller/checker.c", "applicator/receive", "communicator/read", "converter/gnu_linux_console"

        * CONTINUE in: function "decode_http_request_method", by adding everywhere at "decode_http_request_set_parameter" the new function call like:
            // Add fragment to given compound model.
            set_compound_element_by_name(*d, p1, p2,
                k, (void*) &kc, (void*) &kc,
                (void*) CHARACTER_VECTOR_ABSTRACTION, (void*) CHARACTER_VECTOR_ABSTRACTION_COUNT, (void*) CHARACTER_VECTOR_ABSTRACTION_COUNT,
                v, (void*) &vc, (void*) &vc,
                *NULL_POINTER, *NULL_POINTER, *NULL_POINTER);

        //?? TODO: The model and details content p8, p9, p10, p11, p12, p13 need to be RESET (emptied) every time since
        //?? otherwise, new commands are just added to the "action" part entry, in "receive_socket.c"
        * Hand over an empty cybol model (just like for xdt/bdt) containing no entries for: method, scheme, authority, path, fragment, action
        * Introduce new functions to delete the content of an allocated entity (for compound, integer_vector, xdt etc.),
            so that for each new http request, the model is initially empty, in function "receive_socket_message"
        * Adapt function "decode_http_request" accordingly

        * Create three different sockets (local, inet, inet6)? distinguish at socket startup?
            and store as different entries in internal memory?
        * move and rename "set_new_signal_identification" to e.g. /globals/references/integer_references.c
            and name function e.g. "get_integer_reference"
        * Implement session on application level (Res Medicinae)
        * Add the following comment to a matching source code file:

            Since http is a stateless protocol, it does not provide a possibility to
            find out whether or not several consequent http requests belong together.

            Therefore, the application on the next higher level of abstraction has to
            care about that, by opening a "session" for each request from an unknown user.
            Every such session gets a unique identifier called "session id".

            Whenever the client now sends an http request to the server,
            it also sends the session id, so that data already stored on the
            server can be assigned to the correct user.

            There are several ways to transfer a session id:
            1 as cookie
            2 within the uri
                2.1 GET
                    2.1.1 in the query, e.g.:
                        http://domain.tld/index.php?sid=3Dedb0e8665db4e9042fe0176a89aade16
                    2.1.2 in the path
                        http://domain.tld/edb0e8665db4e9042fe0176a89aade16/index.php
                2.2 POST (within html forms, using input elements of type ?hidden")

            Problems:
            1 Many users have cookies deactivated in their browsers.
            However, an application may request to activate cookies.
            2 Each uri of a (generated) webpage has to be modified to contain the session id.
            2.2 All navigation has to occur via html forms (buttons etc.); simple links do not suffice

            In order to avoid users manipulating and using the session id of another user,
            a session id has to be generated from a range of values that is large enough to
            minimise the probability of guessing another user's session id.

        * Store socket of a client, in order to be able to reply to it:
            1 hand over a cybol property, to store the socket in the knowledge tree
                --> no, since low-level sockets should not be known to cybol applications
            2 store many sockets in a special socket container or in internal memory, respectively
                --> not necessary to handle many sockets, since each connection is treated like a new request
            3 hand over socket as additional parameter of a signal, in order to be able to send a reply to the client
                --> replace the "signal id" parameter with the socket
                --> possibly also hand over the communication partner address, if necessary
                --> remove communication partner socket + address from internal memory in turn
                --> close socket after having sent a reply to the requesting client
        * It was decided that "send" operations do NOT run in an own thread (for now and the near future, at least),
            also if querying a server via http, since this would mix up the signal handling mechanism

        * Increase count and size in "*_accessor.c" files automatically and adapt all source code accordingly
            (e.g. "set_compound_element_by_name" increases count and size; do likewise for "integer_vector" etc.)

        * Assign "sizeof" for each programming language type to a global variable just once at startup
            and henceforth use that variable instead of each time determining "sizeof", throughout all source code

        * Use an OR || and compare for numeric character reference and character entity reference, when parsing http requests
        * Distinguish cybol- from memory abstractions
        * Enable multiple abstractions like "character|UTF-32|gzip", separated by
            a "pipe" character and processed one-by-one, in the given order
        * Add more abstractions for date and time (see Wikipedia and ISO/EN/DIN standards)
        * Correct encode for background- and foreground colour in "encode_gnu_linux_console_shape" function of
            "gnu_linux_console_converter.c": allocate destination variables before handing them over as parameters
        * Check all places where "rellocate" is used, if the new array is SET / ASSIGNED new right afterwards
        * Adapt all places in source code where reallocation is used to new
            reallocation factor handling and also shrink memory structures appropriately
        * Include the sources of all documents into the distributable tarball cybop-0.9.0/
            --> really? This will grow it up to 500 MB in size due to the images
        * Adapt all source code to wide characters (UTF-32 Unicode character encoding)
        * Convert CYBOL files to UTF-8 Unicode character encoding
        * Decode CYBOL files after having parsed them --> is the libxml2 parser capable of handling UTF-8?

        * Define data types with fixed length (using preprocessor #define??),
            so that they mean the same on different platforms (see Qt library or Java's types)

        * Write an actual manual that is updated as necessary to reflect the current
            state of cybop; just looking at the papers, it is hard to know what is
            current and what is not; in the meantime, one thing that would help is some
            kind of brief overview of the papers -- especially which ones should be read
            first if someone was trying to use the system; also cautioning about ones
            that are partly outdated, etc.; the list of purported "tutorials" doesn't
            really make sense to beginners either

        * Rename several things in CYBOL files and CYBOI:
            --> the XML tag descriptions (part, property, constraint) in a CYBOL file are special cases with the
                exception that "create" and "receive" information are mixed, in order to serialise models easily;
            --> rename "abstraction" attribute to "language" for all CYBOL tags!
            --> rename "model" attribute to "message" for all CYBOL tags!
            --> a "model" attribute (with new meaning as knowledge model to store received data) is not needed,
                as it gets created internally
            --> an "element" attribute is not needed, as the CYBOL structure determines parts and properties
            --> a "whole" attribute is not needed, as due to the CYBOL structure it is clear that
                    parts belong to the compound in whose file they stand
            --> a "receiver" attribute is not needed as it is clear that this cyboi system itself is the receiver

        * Check out handling of "super" property:
            --> if parts exist, then a new part with the same name (stemming from the same
                model or its super category) must NOT be created!
            --> prevent this in CYBOI, using conditions
            --> only one (super) category makes sense, because templates/ models
                belong to a certain dimension like: TUI, GUI, WUI, domain model;
                so the upper-most category for a tui model may be one that
                provides ALL essential properties like "shape", "border", "background" etc.

        Q: Why should a tui knowledge template NOT be implemented with properties of abstraction "knowledge" or "encapsulated", as follows:

            <part name="apw_entry" channel="inline" abstraction="character" model="a - Starte Arztpraxis Wiegand (APW) im DOS Emulator (DOSemu)">
                <property name="position" channel="inline" abstraction="integer" model="1,3,0"/>
                <property name="size" channel="inline" abstraction="integer" model="68,1,1"/>
                <property name="shape" channel="inline" abstraction="knowledge" model=".revue.settings.tui.shape"/>
                <property name="layout" channel="inline" abstraction="knowledge" model=".revue.settings.tui.layout"/>
                <property name="background" channel="inline" abstraction="knowledge" model=".revue.settings.tui.menu_item_background"/>
                <property name="foreground" channel="inline" abstraction="knowledge" model=".revue.settings.tui.menu_item_foreground"/>
                <property name="bold" channel="inline" abstraction="knowledge" model=".revue.settings.tui.bold"/>
                <property name="previous" channel="inline" abstraction="character" model=".revue.tui.main_window.menu.exit_entry"/>
                <property name="next" channel="inline" abstraction="character" model=".revue.tui.main_window.menu.backup_entry"/>
                <property name="button_press_action" channel="inline" abstraction="character" model=".revue.logic.functionality.start_apw"/>
            </part>

        A1: Because the user interface logic "select_next_part.cybol" and "select_previous_part.cybol",
            and potentially other logic templates do access the properties, in order to set their value, for example:

            <part name="assemble_current_element_background" channel="inline" abstraction="operation" model="add">
                <property name="summand_1" channel="inline" abstraction="knowledge" model=".revue.tui.main_window.menu#focus"/>
                <property name="summand_2" channel="inline" abstraction="character" model="#background"/>
                <property name="sum" channel="inline" abstraction="knowledge" model=".revue.temporary.character"/>
                <property name="abstraction" channel="inline" abstraction="character" model="character"/>
            </part>
            <part name="unfocus_background" channel="inline" abstraction="operation" model="copy">
                <property name="source" channel="inline" abstraction="knowledge" model=".revue.settings.tui.menu_item_background"/>
                <property name="destination" channel="inline" abstraction="encapsulated" model=".revue.temporary.character"/>
                <property name="abstraction" channel="inline" abstraction="character" model="character"/>
            </part>

            This copies a new background colour value from ".revue.settings.tui.menu_item_background" to the
            destination element's property "#background", which is stored in ".revue.temporary.character".
            But by copying the colour value to the "#background" property, that property does not contain
            a knowledge path of the kind ".revue.settings.tui.menu_item_background" anymore, but rather
            a simple colour value like "blue". At that time, the abstraction "knowledge" would NOT be
            correct anymore, because the simple colour value is of abstraction "character" instead.

        A2: Even if CYBOI-internal procedures implemented a mechanism that tried to retrieve the
            real model that a knowledge model path pointed to, this would NOT solve the problem!
            The reason is that then not the actual value of the property would be set, but rather
            the value of the standard setting (!) that the knowledge path pointed to.

            --> RULE to avoid the problems described in A1 and A2:
            Single properties of a textual user interface (tui) should not be stored as knowledge path
            of abstraction "knowledge" or "encapsulated", but always as primitive values.
            To ease application development, however, there is the possibility to use the "super" property,
            which permits the inheritance of properties like colours etc. Following an example:

            <part name="main_window" channel="file" abstraction="compound" model="revue/tui/main_window/window.cybol">
                <property name="super" channel="inline" abstraction="knowledge" model=".revue.settings.tui.window"/>
                <property name="position" channel="inline" abstraction="integer" model="0,0,0"/>
                <property name="size" channel="inline" abstraction="integer" model="80,24,1"/>
            </part>

            A corresponding settings file may look like this:

            <model>
                <part name="shape" channel="inline" abstraction="character" model="rectangle"/>
                <part name="layout" channel="inline" abstraction="character" model="coordinates"/>
                <part name="background" channel="inline" abstraction="character" model="blue"/>
                <part name="foreground" channel="inline" abstraction="character" model="white"/>
                <part name="bold" channel="inline" abstraction="boolean" model="true"/>
            </model>

            CAUTION! The solution proposed above does not (yet) work satisfyingly.
            Only real properties of a knowledge template are created, but NOT those of a super model.
            In other words, a created runtime knowledge model that links to a super model does not
            own the properties of the super model itself. This causes a problem because logic templates
            like "select_next_part.cybol" try to access the properties of a model DIRECTLY, for example
            for setting a colour. But if the property does not exist in the model and only in its
            super model, then it cannot be set.

            --> TODO: For later versions of CYBOI, the super templates/ models must be handled better, either:
            1 at creation time in form of a super template whose properties would get instantiated for the model containing the super property
                it is important that the super template should only deliver the properties for the current template,
                but not be created (instantiated) itself (handle this in CYBOL parser or XML translator)
            2 at runtime, as it is done now in the tui, which gets the properties of a super model at runtime
                the problem here is that the model does not really itself contain the properties of its super model,
                as described above
            ==> solution 1 seems desirable, but would need some thinking on how to implement this in CYBOI
            ==> for now, as temporary solution, the properties are stored redundantly (twice) in the template
                that needs them (for example "menu_item" entries in the resmedicinae-revue menu) and in its super template
