- implement configure/ make setup (standard configure and make options),
for example using automake/autoconf
http://gnu.org/software/automake
there are various tutorials and examples around, such as GNU Hello:
http://gnu.org/software/hello
http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Configuration.html
http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Makefile-Conventions.html

- the tarball should unpack into a single directory, like cybop-0.8.0/

- write an actual manual that is updated as necessary to reflect the current
state of cybop; just looking at the papers, it is hard to know what is
current and what is not; in the meantime, one thing that would help is some
kind of brief overview of the papers -- especially which ones should be read
first if someone was trying to use the system; also cautioning about ones
that are partly outdated, etc.; the list of purported "tutorials" doesn't
really make sense to beginners either

- the README file should explain where to report bugs, relevant mailing lists etc.

- include the sources of all documents into the tarball

- if parts exist, then a new part with the same name (stemming from the same
model or its super category) must NOT be created!
--> Prevent this in CYBOI, using conditions

- only one (super) category makes sense, because templates/ models
belong to a certain dimension like: TUI, GUI, WUI, domain model;
so the upper-most category for a tui model may be one that
provides ALL essential properties like "shape", "border", "background" etc.
