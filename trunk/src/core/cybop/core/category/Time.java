/**
 * This class represents a time.
 *
 * A time specifies the duration of change between two states. 
 *
 * A time is often called the fourth dimension in our abstract model
 * of the real world. It is determined by only one integer number but
 * can have various representations. The most famous representation
 * of time for us humans is the calendar. There are several types of
 * calendars that can be used, e.g. the Gregorian calendar. 
 *
 * It is measured in seconds [s].
