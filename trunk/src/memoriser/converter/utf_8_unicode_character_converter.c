//
// UTF-8 (8-bit UCS/Unicode Transformation Format) is a variable-length
// character encoding for Unicode.
//
// It is able to represent any character in the Unicode standard, yet the
// initial encoding of byte codes and character assignments for UTF-8 is
// backwards compatible with ASCII. For these reasons, it is steadily becoming
// the preferred encoding for e-mail, web pages, and other places where
// characters are stored or streamed.
//
// UTF-8 encodes each character in one to four octets (8-bit bytes):
// 1 One byte is needed to encode the 128 US-ASCII characters
//   (Unicode range U+0000 to U+007F)
// 2 Two bytes are needed for Latin letters with diacritics and for characters
//   from Greek, Cyrillic, Armenian, Hebrew, Arabic, Syriac and Thaana alphabets
//   (Unicode range U+0080 to U+07FF)
// 3 Three bytes are needed for the rest of the Basic Multilingual Plane
//   (which contains virtually all characters in common use)
// 4 Four bytes are needed for characters in the other planes of Unicode,
//   which are rarely used in practice
//
// Four bytes may seem like a lot for one character (code point). However,
// code points outside the Basic Multilingual Plane are generally very rare.
// Furthermore, UTF-16 (the main alternative to UTF-8) also needs four bytes
// for these code points. Whether UTF-8 or UTF-16 is more efficient depends
// on the range of code points being used. However, the differences between
// different encoding schemes can become negligible with the use of
// traditional compression systems like DEFLATE. For short items of text
// where traditional algorithms do not perform well and size is important,
// the Standard Compression Scheme for Unicode could be considered instead.
//
// The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) requires all Internet protocols
// to identify the encoding used for character data with UTF-8 as at least one
// supported encoding. The Internet Mail Consortium (IMC) recommends that all
// email programs be able to display and create mail using UTF-8.
