Introduction
____________

The "Cybernetics Oriented Interpreter" (CYBOI) works on a rather low
system level. It manages the storage of knowledge in memory, contains
input/ output (i/o) mechanisms, handles signals and more. Because of
CYBOI's closeness to hardware, the "von Neumann" model was chosen to
structure its source code. Von Neumann's original model suggests three
main parts, which are listed together with their names in CYBOI, below:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
von Neumann                         | CYBOI
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Memory                              | memory
Control Unit                        | controller
Algorithmic Logic Unit (ALU)        | computer
------------------------------------------------------------------------
